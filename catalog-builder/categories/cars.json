There was a car show at the park, and I was able to get a few shots. The guys that restore these antiques have a lot of patience. \n\nThe Morris Motor Company was a British car manufacturing company. After the incorporation of the company into larger corporations, the Morris name remained in use as a marque until 1984 when British Leyland's Austin Rover Group decided to concentrate on the more popular Austin marque.\n\nA woodie is a type of car, more specifically an early station wagon in which the rear portion of the car's bodywork is made of wood. Frequently this wood is visible, since it is covered in a clear finish, either over the entire wooden area or sometimes just on the framework with the interior panels painted.\n\nIt is a derivative of the body-on-frame method of car construction. Earlier cars generally had aluminum or steel panels bolted on top of the wood framing. Woodies were originally cheaper because they didn't need these panels and their fitment and painting. So railway stations used them for hackwork of luggage and petty shipments; hence the name, station wagon. The tradition of the woodie remains in the woodgrain decals and plastic beams attached to a structural steel body of many station wagons.\n\nThis car body style was popular both in the United States and the United Kingdom. Woodies were produced from all kinds of cars, from basic to luxury, but the most popular conversions in the US were large, powerful but not highly luxurious models. By contrast, in Europe early woodies were usually built on luxury car platforms such as Rolls-Royce.\n\nBy the 1960s and to some degree the 1970s, California surfers, among others, realised the potential of these cars; they were cheap, large enough to carry a good number of people, surfboards and equipment, and could be fixed up with woodworking skills. Thus, the woodie became the archetypal vehicle of the surfer.", "title": "1955 Morris-Oxford Woodie: Haliburton Fall Festival Antique Car Show, October 2009"}, "id": "4064859578", "title": "1955 Morris-Oxford Woodie: Haliburton Fall Festival Antique Car Show, October 2009"}

Elle embarque un moteur V10 d'une cylindr\u00e9 de 5 L pour une puissance de 507 ch \u00e0 7750 tr/min et une couple de 520 Nm \u00e0 6100 tr/min. Elle est \u00e9quip\u00e9e d'une bo\u00eete s\u00e9quentielle \u00e0 7 rapports.\n\nLa M6 est plus longue de 5 cm par rapport \u00e0 la Serie 6, plus large de 0,5 cm et plus lourde de 95 kg par rapport \u00e0 la 650i. C'est en 2007 que la M6 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clin\u00e9e en cabriolet, qui est un peu moins performante.\n\nIn 1983 BMW took the M88/3 six-cylinder engine, a modified version of the M88/1 from the BMW M1 and put it in the E24 chassis of the BMW 6-Series, creating the M635CSi (called the M6 in North America).\nThe M6 was critically acclaimed throughout its lifespan for its elegant, aggressive &quot;shark-nose&quot; styling, its luxury equipment, and its performance. A top speed of 255 km/h (158 mph) makes the European version the second fastest BMW ever built next to the M1. This is due to all other BMW models being electronically restricted to 250 km/h (155 mph). However, Rug Cunninham BMW ran a bone stock 1987 BMW M6 in the La Carrera Classic Race in Mexico in 1989, and reportedly recorded a top speed of 283 km/h (176 mph) indicated. An M6 can be distinguished from other E24 models by a larger front air dam, a rear spoiler, BBS wheels, colour matching side view mirrors, M badges on the grille and back, and slightly larger front brakes.\nIn North America (United States and Canada), the E24 M6 was fitted with the catalyzed S38B35 motor, producing 191 kW (256 bhp) and 329 N\u00b7m (243 lbf\u00b7ft) of torque. The non-catalyzed version produced 213 kW (286 bhp) and 340 N\u00b7m (251 lb\u00b7ft) of torque. The non-catalyzed versions were only available in Europe, though there were 538 catalyzed M635csi models sold in Europe in 1988 and 1989. The 1988 and 1989 the M6 was a &quot;world car&quot; with the same bumpers and aerodynamic treatments in all markets.\nThe M6 achieved 0\u201397 km/h (0\u201360 mph) time of 6.0 and 6.8 seconds for the European and American versions, respectively.\nQuarter mile times for the European version have been recorded at 14.5 seconds while 161 km/h (100 mph) is achieved in 15 seconds. However, Car and Driver Magazine tested the U.S. M6 in July 1987 and achieved a 0\u201397 km/h (0\u201360 mph) time of 6.1 seconds. Also in 1987 Road and Track featured the U.S. M6 as one of the 10 fastest cars in America. Production of the M6 ended in 1989, with 5,859 cars sold, 1,767 of which were North American (U.S. &amp; Canada) models.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.supercar-roadtrip.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.supercar-roadtrip.fr/</a>", "title": "Championnat Europ\u00e9en de DRIFT - Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac Gironde 13 et 14 septembre 2014 - BMW M6 - Moteur Engine Puissance Power Car Speed Vitesse Explorer Explore Circuit Champion - Picture Image Photography - King of Europe KOE turbo oil huile frein brake htt"}, "id": "15243310666", "title": "Championnat Europ\u00e9en de DRIFT - Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac Gironde 13 et 14 septembre 2014 - BMW M6 - Moteur Engine Puissance Power Car Speed Vitesse Explorer Explore Circuit Champion - Picture Image Photography - King of Europe KOE turbo oil huile frein brake htt"}

The now privately-owned Mark 2 Jaguar is a fully marked police car, which patrolled the M6 in Staffordshire some 40 years ago.\n\nOfficers from the Central Motorway Police Group, the team which covers 450 miles of the nation\u2019s busiest motorways and major A roads, will be showcasing their work, whilst offering some fun, but informative advice on how to stay safe.\n\nSince April 2010 CMPG officers seized controlled drugs to the value of \u00a37.4 million, assets worth \u00a34.6 million and an additional \u00a34.6 million of cash from criminals on the motorway network.\n\nChief Superintendent Martin Evans, CMPG commander, says his officers should provide an interesting stop off for the many enthusiasts at the popular Midlands-based show.\n\n\u201cAutosport International is attended by tens of thousands of people who are all interested in cars, bikes and motorsport in particular and that is just the audience who we\u2019re keen to engage with about the good work we do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find the fully-kitted out cars of interest, whilst seeing some of the very different things we do to catch criminals, whilst keeping people safe on the roads.\n\n\u201cOfficers from the regional Collision Investigation Unit will also be on hand to talk about the horrors, and the causes, of so many of the major crashes that they deal with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also be urging people to try on our \u2018beer goggles\u2019 which we use to educate people about just how much of an impact drinking alcohol can have on you before you step behind the wheel.\u201d\n\nCentral Motorway Police Group\u2019s finest will be exhibiting, free of charge, alongside some of the greats from the motorsport world, including Sir Jackie Stewart, British Force India Formula One star Paul di Resta, British Touring Car champion Gordon Shedden and five-time 24 Hour Le Mans winner, Emmanuel Pirro. Every single Grand Prix winning car from the 2012 season will also be on display.\n\nCSupt Evans added: \u201cOur aim is to engage with the public and discuss issues within motorway and roads policing which concern them.\n\n\u201cWhether people are regular users of the motorway network, or they travel on our patch once in a blue moon, the advice and information we can give will be of interest.\n\n\u201cIssues such as anti social driving, excess speed and using gadgets whilst on the move apply no matter whether it\u2019s a small residential road or the M6.\n\n\u201cI seriously hope that by exhibiting at the show we will increase the public\u2019s awareness of both the work we do to keep road users safe, as well as passing on crucial advice to change the mindset of the minority whose actions sit outside of the law.\u201d", "title": "Day 12 - New police car set to drive down crime"}, "id": "8369631623", "title": "Day 12 - New police car set to drive down crime"}

Dans la foul\u00e9e Pascal Thomasse obtint deux podiums en Championnat de France D2, en 1990 et 1994.\n\nElle \u00e9tait d\u00e9clin\u00e9e tant en version &quot;Groupe N&quot; qu'en &quot;Groupe A&quot;.\n\nElle est \u00e0 l'heure actuelle toujours utilis\u00e9e par de nombreux pilotes amateurs, partout en Europe (entre'autres en Coupe de France des rallyes, o\u00f9 elle s'est impos\u00e9e sans discontinuer entre 1990 et 1995, puis en 1998 (E30 et E36): Hugues Delage obtint les coupes 1990, 1993 et 1994, et Dominique de Meyer celle de l'ann\u00e9e 1991 et la finale de 1995 (Christophe Lapierre vainqueur de la coupe 1992, et Patrick Rouillard de celle 1998 pour la derni\u00e8re fois de l'\u00e9volution M3); au Liban Nabil Karam s'est impos\u00e9 en 1991).\n\nEn Championnat d'Europe de course de c\u00f4te, elle a remport\u00e9 le titre de Cat\u00e9gorie I \u00e0 cinq reprises cons\u00e9cutives avec Francis Dosi\u00e8res entre 1989 et 1993 (voiture homologu\u00e9e Gr.A); s'en suivirent de nombreux autres titres toujours de Cat\u00e9gorie I pour les versions ult\u00e9rieures de la M3 Gr.A, avec le tch\u00e8que Otakar Kr\u00e1msk\u00fd (1995, 1997 et 1998), le croate Niko Puli\u0107 (1999, 2000 et 2001), le tch\u00e8que Robert \u0160enk\u00fd\u0159 (2003 et 2004) et l'allemand J\u00f6rg Weidinger (2005 et 2006), soit 15 titres de championne d'Europe entre 1989 et 2006. Le Challenge international de la montagne (FCHA) de la FIA ne lui a pas non plus \u00e9chapp\u00e9, avec le hongrois L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hern\u00e1di (2006, 2007 et 2008).\n\nEn Tourisme et Grand Tourisme, le titre mondial Tourisme 1987 (le seul attribu\u00e9 durant 18 ans) revint \u00e0 l'italien Roberto Ravaglia (victoires de la M3 \u00e0 Jarama, Dijon, aux 24 Heures de Spa, et \u00e0 Silverstone), le Championnat d'Europe FIA des voitures de tourisme fut remport\u00e9 en 1987 par Winfried Vogt (plus titre constructeurs) et en 1988 par Roberto Ravaglia, le Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (D.T.M.) pilotes (Tourisme) fut gagn\u00e9 en 1987 par Eric van de Poele et en 1989 encore par Roberto Ravaglia (plus les titres constructeurs de 1987 \u00e0 1990), le BTCC (British Touring Cars Championship) le fut par deux fois avec Frank Sytner (1988) et Will Hoy (1991, et titre constructeur), le Championnat de France de Supertourisme le fut aussi par deux fois gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Jean-Pierre Malcher (1989 et 1990; plus Dayraut en 2001 sur la version Silhouette), et le titre national Belge Grand Tourisme 1996 revint \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipage Hubert/Hubert/Duez; la voiture remporta notamment les 24 Heures du N\u00fcrburgring en 1989 (avec Ravaglia), 1990, 1991 et 1992 (Duez alors laur\u00e9at), puis 1994, 1996 et 1997 (E36 pour les deux derni\u00e8res dates), et les 24 Heures de Spa en 1987, 1988 (avec Ravaglia), 1990 et 1992.\n\nRavaglia a ainsi pu obtenir le WTCC (1987), l'ETCC (1988) et le DTM (1989) avec la M3. Dans la foul\u00e9e il a aussi remport\u00e9 le Campionato Italiano Superturismo en 1990 et 1991 (16 victoires en deux ans).

En effet, d'un point de vue esth\u00e9tique, la ligne est enti\u00e8rement revue.\n\nMais c'est au niveau du moteur que la division &quot;M&quot; de BMW a effectu\u00e9 les plus gros changements : le 4 cylindres de l'E30 est remplac\u00e9 par un 6 cylindres en ligne de 3 L et gagne ainsi, dans un premier temps, plus de 50 chevaux pour atteindre, sur la premi\u00e8re version d'E36, 286 ch.

Au niveau du moteur, elle poss\u00e8de une m\u00e9canique bien peu ordinaire. En effet, le six-cylindres 3,2 L de la version pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente est reconduit mais a gagn\u00e9 45 cm3, 22 ch et 1,3 mkg de couple, obtenus 1 650 tr/min plus haut. Avec un rendement exceptionnel de 106 ch/litre, ce bloc vient rejoindre le podium des meilleurs \u00ab atmos \u00bb du moment, juste derri\u00e8re la Honda S2000 et la Ferrari 360 Modena. Au-del\u00e0 des chiffres, la disponibilit\u00e9 de cette m\u00e9canique sur une large plage d'utilisation r\u00e9jouit tout autant que sa sonorit\u00e9 sportive \u00e0 souhait. Un bouton &quot;sport&quot; au tableau de bord am\u00e9liore la r\u00e9ponse des injecteurs et permet une conduite encore plus active. Au tableau de bord, un compte-tours &quot;thermostatique&quot; vous aide \u00e0 prendre soin du bijou. Moteur froid, des diodes orange ponctuent chaque 500 tr/min \u00e0 partir de 4 000 tr/min. Elles s'\u00e9teignent ensuite une \u00e0 une quand le moteur monte en temp\u00e9rature. Avec ses 343 ch, elle effectue le 0 \u00e0 100 km/h en 5&quot;25, 80 \u00e0 120 en 5&quot;4 (en 4e). Cette nouvelle version ne fait pas beaucoup mieux que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente car elle a grossi et son rapport poids/puissance reste donc inchang\u00e9. Niveau consommation, la M3 E46 consomme 11,5 L/100 km, mais peut consommer jusqu'\u00e0 60 L/100 km en activant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le bouton &quot;sport&quot; sur le tableau de bord. En ce qui concerne le freinage, talon d'Achille des BMW M, comme sur l'ancienne version, les quatre grands disques sont suffisants en temps normal, mais leur efficacit\u00e9 est rapidement mise \u00e0 mal en rythme soutenu pour stopper les 1 500 kg de cette sportive. La M3 E46 perp\u00e9tue avec brio la r\u00e9putation li\u00e9e \u00e0 son nom.

Constitu\u00e9 d'un bloc en alliage d'aluminium et de silicium, le moteur de la BMW M3 affiche une puissance sp\u00e9cifique de 105 ch par litre de cylindr\u00e9e. Son couple maximum atteint les 400 Nm \u00e0 3 900 tr/min, dont 85 % d\u00e9livr\u00e9 sur une plage de plus de 6 500 tr/min. La M3 se dote en effet d'une distribution variable de 8 papillons de gaz et d'un alternateur d\u00e9brayable.\nS\u00e9ries limit\u00e9es\n\nEn novembre 2009, BMW lance la M3 GTS limit\u00e9e \u00e0 250 exemplaires. Sur le plan des performances, elle garde son V8 dont la puissance a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 450 ch. Sur le plan de l'esth\u00e9tique, elle se pare d'une couleur orange exclusive avec un aileron typ\u00e9 course. \u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur, BMW adapte la recette qui a fait le succ\u00e8s de la Porsche 911 GT3 RS : pas de GPS, ni de climatisation et des lani\u00e8res en guise de poign\u00e9es de portes. Enfin, le coup\u00e9 perd ses deux places \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re, et les remplace par un arceau-cage couleur carrosserie, un extincteur de course, donnant l'impression qu'il s'agit plus d'une b\u00eate de course qu'une voiture de tous les jours. Elle est d'ailleurs souvent compar\u00e9e \u00e0 la BMW M3 GTR E46.\n\nL'ann\u00e9e suivante, BMW d\u00e9voile la M3 Frozen Gray. Produite \u00e0 seulement trente exemplaires, et seulement aux \u00c9tats-Unis, elle se reconna\u00eet par sa teinte grise matte (r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9e comme Frozen Gray chez BMW), ses jantes 19 pouces \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, et son cuir bi-ton roux et noir \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Le moteur conserve ses 420 chevaux, mais la bo\u00eete DCT \u00e0 double embrayage est fournie de s\u00e9rie. Tout acheteur de cette Frozen Gray se verra offrir un stage de la BMW Performance Driving School.\n\nEn juin 2011, un mod\u00e8le encore plus exclusif la CRT (pour Carbon Racing Technology), bas\u00e9 sur la M3 Saloon E90 fait la part belle au carbone, permettant la perte de 45 kg, le tout en gardant les \u00e9quipements de confort (GPS et climatisation) qui font d'elle une berline de luxe. Elle est produite \u00e0 seulement 67 exemplaires, le moteur garde ses 420 chevaux, mais il s'agit de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition sp\u00e9ciale de la M3 qui n'est disponible qu'en berline 4 portes. Toutefois, il faut noter qu'\u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re, ce ne sont plus trois personnes, mais deux personnes qui pourront s'y asseoir, dans deux beaux si\u00e8ges baquets. Elle se reconna\u00eet par sa teinte grise matte son cuir rouge, et ses jantes Full Black.\n\nEn 2012, BMW sort 3 s\u00e9ries sp\u00e9ciales de sa M3 en France. La M3 CS, la M3 Frozen 40 et la M3 DTM Champion Edition. La M3 CS, exclusivement fran\u00e7aise, se distingue par une teinte bleue matte \u00e9clatante (Frozen Blau), ainsi que par son int\u00e9rieur aux surpiq\u00fbres bleues, avec une touche de rouge sur le volant. Il s'agit d'une version d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9e aux vir\u00e9es sur circuit. La M3 Frozen 40, elle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour toute l'Europe, et c\u00e9l\u00e9brait les 40 ans de BMW Motorsport. Elle se distingue \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'une M3 \u00ab normale \u00bb gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une calandre chrom\u00e9e, ainsi que des sorties d'\u00e9chappement et des ou\u00efes lat\u00e9rales noires. La version Frozen 40 dispose aussi de 4 coloris sp\u00e9cifiques mats, toutes nomm\u00e9es Frozen, que ce soit en bleu, bleu fonc\u00e9, blanc ou rouge. \u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur, la sellerie est exclusive, et les surpiq\u00fbres sont assorties \u00e0 la teinte ext\u00e9rieure. Enfin, la version M3 DTM Champion Edition est un hommage \u00e0 Bruno Spengler, le pilote canadien victorieux du championnat allemand DTM sur BMW M3. Elle est tr\u00e8s facilement reconnaissable, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa teinte matte Frozen Black, ses bandes de pavillon aux couleurs de Motorsport, ainsi que le sticker sponsor sur la vitre de custode. Les jantes full black rajoutent une touche d'agressivit\u00e9 \u00e0 la voiture. \u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur, les inserts en carbone re\u00e7oivent la signature de Bruno Spengler, ainsi qu'une num\u00e9rotation. Seulement 54 exemplaires seront produits.\n\nThe BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3-Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M. M3 models have been derived from the E30, E36, E46, E90/E92/E93, and F30 3-series, and sold with coupe, saloon and convertible body styles. Upgrades over the &quot;standard&quot; 3-Series automobiles include more powerful and responsive engines, improved handling/suspension/braking systems, aerodynamic body enhancements, and interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour &quot;M&quot; (Motorsport) emblem. The last M3 coupe was produced in Germany on 5 July 2013. Part of BMW's renumbering to move the 3-Series coupe and convertible to the 4-Series, the M3 name will remain with the saloon version as the coupe version has ceased production and has been replaced by the M4 Coupe starting with the 2015 model year.\n\nE92 M3 ZCP Competition Package\n\nFor 2011, BMW added the ZCP Competition Package to the M3\u2019s lineup. Unlike the ZCP offered on the previous generation E46, the newest package didn\u2019t change very much about the E92. Most of the adjustments were made to suspension components and the computer governing stability control. The changes for the E92 ZCP are as follows:\n\n- The suspension has been lowered by 10mm. The spring rates are the same, but the springs themselves are shorter, to compensate for the shorter stance. The suspension\u2019s shock damping was also adjusted by the M division. This was in order to compensate for the lower ride height, primarily for rebounding damping rates as opposed to actual compression.\n\n- The Electronic Damper Control in the \u201cSport Mode\u201d has been modified. A quote taken from the Manager of BMWNA\u2019s M Division, Larry Koch: \u201cThe Sport Mode before ZCP was locked at 75% of the way to full stiff. It still has that as a default, but is now variable like the \u2018Comfort\u2019 and \u2018Normal\u2019 modes.\u201d This translates to a stiffer ride whilst sport mode is engaged, aiding heavy cornering on a track at a cost to ride comfort when driving normally on the road.\n\n- Modifications have been made to the computer governing the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) in M Dynamic Mode. It is reworked and renamed to \u201cDynamic Traction Control\u201d (DTC) which allows for larger angles of slip in heavy cornering. This translates to the rear end sliding out further than would be allowed on a non-ZCP M3 before the DTC kicks in to stop the tail slide. Also, once the DTC does kick in, instead of cutting power to the wheels in order to correct the slide (which is normal for the DSC on stock M3s), the DTC computer instead applies the brakes to individual wheels in order to keep the car from spinning excessively.\n\n- In addition, forged 19 inch wheels in the same style as those on the E46 CSL are added to the car.\nE92 M3 GTS\nM3 GTS at the Autosport International Show 2011.\n\nBMW announced the M3 GTS in November 2009. The car is powered by a 4.4-litre V8 based on the 4.0-litre engine found in the standard M3, which produces a maximum of 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp). The car weighs 300 pounds less than the standard M3 due to various weight savings. A total of only 250 units were produced. This can accelerate from 0-62 mph in just 4.3 seconds and 0-100 mph in 8.5 seconds. In Germany deliveries began in May 2010 while other countries were scheduled for the summer of 2010. The BMW E92 M3 GTS was priced at around \u20ac115,000 per unit. All E92 M3 GTS models have been sold.\nE90 M3 CRT\n\nThe M3 CRT (Carbon Racing Technology) was announced in June 2011 as a 2012 model. It is powered by the same engine as the GTS, but in opposite to the GTS coupe with roll cage and 4-point harnesses, the CRT is a saloon with navigation, high-end sound system etc. as standard equipment. Despite these luxury extras, the car still weighs 100 lb (45 kg) less than a regular M3 saloon. Compared to a saloon with the same luxury equipment, it weighs 155 lb (70 kg) less. The production will be limited to 67 cars, all numbered with a plaque on the dashboard. And it is claimed that it can accelerate from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 4.4 seconds. \nE92 M3 DTM Champion Edition\n\nBMW Motorsport returned to the DTM in 2012, and the &quot;DTM Champion Edition&quot; was built to commemorate it winning the championship. The &quot;DTM Champion Edition&quot; was available only in the Frozen Black paint finish with the same M stripes over the roof and boot lid as on Bruno Spengler\u2019s race car. It also incorporated visual clues to the race car, such as carbon flaps and gurney, dark chrome elements and matt black wheels. The interior had some exclusive parts such as interior trim in carbon fibre, Alcantara steering wheel and &quot;M Power&quot; embroidered on the handbrake grip. Each car had a numbered plaque with Spengler's signature and the text &quot;DTM champion 2012&quot; above the glove box.\n\nAs the car was focused on high performance, options as M Drive, M DCT Drivelogic and the M Driver\u2019s Package were fitted as standard equipment. For the car to have everyday usability, options as navigation system, heated seats and PDC were also standard.\n\nThe DTM Champion Edition was produced from February 2013, in a limited number of 54 cars, the same number as BMW's victories in DTM. In Germany, the price started at \u20ac99,000.00 including VAT.\nE92 M3 Lime Rock Park Edition\n\nThe M3 Lime Rock Park Edition was a US specific model, with a production limited to 200 cars, painted in Fire Orange. All 200 of these 2013 vehicles came with carbon fiber performance parts, such as roof, front splitter, rear spoiler, competition package, a lowered ride height in front of .60 inches, track style steering with fewer turns to lock and a lightweight muffler, courtesy of BMW's MGmbh division. BMW claims the model has no added horsepower, however, when marketing the lightweight Inconel-titanium BMW Motorsports Exhaust to stock M3 vehicles, BMW Claims that the system adds about 5 H.P. The Lime Rock Park editions were equipped with either 6 speed transmissions, or the optional DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission). No changes made to the original 4.0L V8 (414 HP, redline 8300 rpm); however the ECU is programmed slightly differently from standard M3 vehicles with less interference from the dynamic stability control and a less interfering traction control. Each LRP edition's governor is limited for achieving its natural top speed, which is claimed to be 187 MPH (Roughly 300 kph). Each M3 LRP Edition comes with a numbered plaque and paper certificate, each one reading &quot;One of 200&quot; instead of a numbering sequence. BMW did this to ensure none of the cars were worth more than another.\nRacing\nRahal Letterman M3 GT2 racing at the 2009 Petit Le Mans\nSchnitzer Motorsport's BMW M3 GT2 racing at the 2010 1000 km of Zhuhai.\nE92 M3 GT2\n\nBMW Motorsport announced in February 2008 that Rahal Letterman Racing will campaign two factory-backed E92 M3s in the American Le Mans Series in 2009, following a two-year absence by the brand. The cars are homologated for the GT2 category. This was the cover car for the simulation racing game Need for Speed: Shift. Schnitzer Motorsport entered 2 cars at the 1000 km of Spa and finished 4th after a move by the Ferrari in the final corner. For 2010, BMW Motorsport has been granted entry in the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans and in the 2010 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring. BMW Motorsport/Schnitzer Motorsport went onto to take an overall win at the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring with the #25 M3 GT2 of J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller, Augusto Farfus, Pedro Lamy, and Uwe Alzen while the top competitors from Porsche and Audi dropped out one by one. In addition, one of the M3 GT2's that competed at Le Mans (#79) has been chosen as the 17th BMW Art Car, which will be done by American artist, Jeff Koons. At the 2010 24 Hours of Spa, BMW qualified 1st in class (2nd overall) and maintained 1st with the #79 car throughout the race until it succumbed to a suspension failure with just half an hour remaining, forcing them to give the overall lead to two Porsche 997 GT3-RSRs. The M3s still came 1st in the GTN class. The BMW M3s won the GT2 category in the ILMC 1000 km of Zhuhai. In 2011, the BMW achieved a 1-2 finish in the 12 Hours of Sebring. In the 2011 American Le Mans Series GT class, BMW Team RLL swept all categories, winning the GT manufacturer, team and driver championships. They contest another year in the ALMS GT class, coming off of another fantastic win at the 2012 60th running of the 12 Hours of Sebring. The M3 GT2 was succeeded by the BMW Z4 GTE, an LMGTE specification racing car alongside the Group GT3 spec BMW Z4 GT3. The Z4 GTE started racing at the 2013 12 Hours of Sebring.\nE92 M3 GT4\n\nOn 10 April 2009, the week after the debut of the GT4, BMW's Customer Racing program announced it had partnered with Schubert Motorsport (sponsored by Motorsport Arena Oschersleben) to run the BMW M3 GT4 in the 2009 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring race, in the new class for GT4 cars, listed as SP10 there. The BMW M3 GT4 also raced in the N\u00fcrburgring VLN ADAC Westfalenfahrt in April 2009, taking the win in the SP10 class and finishing 30th overall. The 2009 24h race took place on the weekend of 23 and 24 May, with J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller, Andy Priaulx and sport auto journalist Jochen \u00dcbler at the wheel. Despite qualifying as best SP10/GT4 car at 57th overall and being at least 10 seconds per lap faster, the team finished third in the class, behind two Aston Martin V8 Vantage N24. The overall rank was 47th.\n\nBMW Motorsport announced on 7 July 2009 the launch of a line of BMW M3 race cars which meet the SRO/FIA's GT4 spec and are oriented for sale to private teams and drivers. The BMW M3 GT4 price is 121,500 EUR without VAT. While BMW states that 'the BMW M3 GT4 weighs just 1,430 kilograms' and the '420 bhp engine remained largely untouched', the 2010 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring &quot;Balance of Performance&quot; requires that the power must not exceed 390 PS (385 HP), while the minimum weight is set to 1400 kg.\n\nThe M3 GT4 is offered in Europe as a homologated production race car for sale to the general public. According to Larry Koch, then BMW NA M-brand manager, a feasibility study is currently being conducted to evaluate the possible sale of the M3 GT4 in North America. However, without a sanctioned GT4-class racing series in the USA, the sale of the M3 GT4 in the States is not likely.\nCritical reception\n\n    Arthur St. Antoine of Motor Trend magazine says: &quot;World's single greatest car? Seriously? Yes \u2013 the new BMW M3 is unquestionably a contender. Probably no other car combines so many virtues \u2013 speed, handling, good looks, roominess, practicality \u2013 into one package. Driving the new BMW M3 is an absolutely blissful experience, flooding your brain with dopamine as if you were arriving to courtside seats at the Lakers game with Jennifer Connelly on your arm.&quot; -and- &quot;If you put an F1 car and a premium sedan in a blender, the M3 would be the cocktail that pours out. Mmmm, nothing else like it. A toast then: To the BMW M3, the greatest all-around car in the world.&quot;\n    Mark Gillies of Car and Driver magazine says: &quot;A car has got to be pretty spectacular to win over the curmudgeons here at 1585 Eisenhower Place, especially when familiarity sets in over the course of 40,000 miles. But our Sparkling Graphite Metallic M3 did indeed win us over.&quot;, and &quot;Based on our experience, the current M3 is the world's all-around best car for the money, although several staffers would have preferred to trade some of the coupe's looks for the added practicality of the sedan.&quot;, and &quot;This is the finest car on the market, period.&quot;\n    Ezra Dyer of Automobile magazine once suggested that &quot;...car magazines generally regard the M3 the same way a four-year-old regards Santa Claus.&quot;\n    Jeremy Clarkson of BBC television show Top Gear says: &quot;This [The M3] is the best car, and always will be, and there's no point in ever thinking otherwise.&quot;\n    Mark Magrath of Edmunds Inside Line wrote these comments after driving a 2009 E90 M3 saloon in the canyons of Southern California: &quot;This is the best most complete car in the world. It's actually a bargain for what you get. Wow.&quot;\n    In the high-performance sports luxury niche (an entry-level luxury/compact executive car with a V8 engine), the E90 M3 (usually an E92 M3 Coup\u00e9 being tested) has won comparison tests against rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, Lexus IS-F, Audi RS4, Audi RS5 and Cadillac CTS-V.", "title": "Championnat Europ\u00e9en de DRIFT - Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac Gironde 13 et 14 septembre 2014 - BMW M3 - Moteur Engine Puissance Power Car Speed Vitesse - Picture Image Photography - King of Europe KOE turbo oil huile frein brake transmission www.supercar-road.fr"}, "id": "15051480728", "title": "Championnat Europ\u00e9en de DRIFT - Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac Gironde 13 et 14 septembre 2014 - BMW M3 - Moteur Engine Puissance Power Car Speed Vitesse - Picture Image Photography - King of Europe KOE turbo oil huile frein brake transmission www.supercar-road.fr"}

The road-going RS200 was based on Ford's Group B rally car and was designed to comply with FIA homologation regulations, which required 200 road legal versions be built. It was first displayed to the public at the Belfast Motor Show.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the MKIII Escort in 1980, Ford Motorsport set about development of rear-wheel-drive, turbocharged variant of the vehicle that could be entered into competition in Group B rally racing, and dubbed the new vehicle the Escort RS 1700T. A problem-filled development led Ford to abandon the project in frustration in 1983, leaving them without a new vehicle to enter into Group B. Not wanting to abandon Group B or simply &quot;write off&quot; the cost of developing the failed 1700T, executives decided to make use of the lessons learned developing that vehicle in preparing a new, purpose-built rally car. In addition, Ford executives became adamant that the new vehicle feature four-wheel-drive, an addition they felt would be necessary to allow it the ability to compete properly with four-wheel-drive models from Peugeot and Audi.\n\nRS200 at the Race Retro 2008.\n\nThe new vehicle was a unique design, featuring a plastic/fiberglass composite body designed by Ghia, a mid-mounted engine and four-wheel drive. The cars were built on behalf of Ford by another company well known for its expertise in producing fibreglass bodies - Reliant. To aid weight distribution, designers mounted the transmission at the front of the car, but this required that power from the mid mounted engine go first up to the front wheels and then be run back again to the rear, creating a complex drive train setup. The chassis was designed by former Formula One designer Tony Southgate, and Ford's John Wheeler, a former F1 engineer, aided in early development. A double wishbone suspension setup with twin dampers on all four wheels aided handling and helped give the car what was often regarded as being the best balanced platform of any of the RS200's contemporary competitors. Such was the rush to complete the RS200, the Ford parts bin was extensively raided - the front windscreen and rear lights were identical to those of the early Sierra, for example, while the side windows were cut-down Sierra items.\n\nThe mid-engined RS200's engine bay and rear suspension.\n\nPower came from a 1.8 litre, single turbocharged Ford/Cosworth &quot;BDT&quot; engine producing 250 horsepower (190 kW) in road-going trim, and between 350 and 450 horsepower (340 kW) in racing trim; upgrade kits were available for road-going versions to boost power output to over 300 horsepower (220 kW). Although the RS had the balance and poise necessary to be competitive, its power-to-weight ratio was poor by comparison, and its engine produced notorious low-RPM lag, making it difficult to drive and ultimately less competitive. Factory driver Kalle Grundel's third place finish at the 1986 WRC Rally of Sweden represented the vehicle's best-ever finish in Group B rallying competition, although the model did see limited success outside of the ultra-competitive Group B class.\n\n However, only one event later, at the Rally de Portugal, a Ford RS200 was involved in one of the most dramatic accidents in WRC history, claiming the lives of 3 spectators and injuring many others.[1] Another Ford RS200 was crashed by Swiss Formula One driver Marc Surer against a tree during the 1986 Hessen-Rallye in Germany, killing his co-driver and friend Michel Wyder instantly.\n\nThe accident at Rally Portugal set off a chain reaction and the RS200 became obsolete after only one full year of competition as the FIA, the governing board, which at the time controlled WRC rally racing, abolished Group B after the 1986 season. For 1987, Ford had planned to introduce an &quot;Evolution&quot; variant of the RS200, featuring a development of the BDT engine (called BDT-E) displacing 2137 cc, developed by Briton Brian Hart. Power figures for the engine vary quite a bit from source to source, but output claims range from as &quot;little&quot; as 550 horsepower (410 kW) to as high as 815 horsepower (608 kW); it has been said that the most powerful Evolution models can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) in just over 2 seconds, depending on gearing. Upgraded brakes and suspension components were part of the package as well. The ban on Group B racing effectively forced the E2 model into stillbirth; however, more than one dozen of them were successfully run from August 1986 till October 1992 in the FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers events all over Europe, and Norwegian Martin Schanche claimed the 1991 European Rallycross title with a Ford RS200 E2 that produced over 650 bhp (480 kW).\n\n\nFord RS200 at The Spirit of Rally 2005.\n\nOne RS200 found its way in circuit racing originated as a road car; it was converted to IMSA GTO specification powered by a 750+ BHP 2.0 litre turbo BDTE Cosworth Evolution engine.[2] Competing against the numerous factory backed teams such as Mazda, Mercury and Nissan, with their newly built spaceframe specials, despite being a privateer, the car never achieved any real success to be a serious contender[3][4][5] and was kept by the original owner. A parts car was built in England and later used to compete in the Unlimited category at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, where it was driven by Swede Stig Blomqvist in 2001, 2002 and 2004 [6] and in 2009 by former British Rallycross Champion Mark Rennison.\n\nProduction\n\n\nFIA homologation rules for Group B required the construction of at least 200 road-legal vehicles, and Ford constructed these 200 units with spare parts for another 20+ units put aside for the racing teams. Those chassis and spare parts were later also used to build a couple of non-genuine, so-called bitsa cars.\n\nA total of 24 of the 200 original cars were reportedly later converted to the so-called &quot;Evolution&quot; models, mostly marked by their owners as &quot;E&quot; or &quot;E2&quot; types. Ford's first intention was to mark the FIA-required 20 &quot;Evo&quot; cars as series numbers 201 to 220 but as this was actually not necessary according to the FIA rules they later kept their original series numbers (e.g. 201 = 012, 202 = 146, 203 = 174 et cetera).\n\nThe original bodywork tooling for the Ford RS200 was latterly bought by Banham Conversions, who used it to make a kit car version based on the Austin Maestro. Due to being a basic re-body of the Maestro, the Austin-Rover engine ancillaries are actually to be found at the front of the vehicle.\n\nNote: This car was used in rally by &quot;Diabolique Team&quot;. Team Diabolique was the most fierd private team in any rally it entered, struggling hard even against factory teams. It still lives inside the memories of rally entusiast in Portugal 16 years after it vanished. Today many fans spent enourmous amounts of money to put their hands on stuff belonging to the team, some spending well over 60.000\u20ac restoring ex-team cars.", "title": "Ford RS 200 (this is the car involved in The accident at Rally Portugal)"}, "id": "11799405975", "title": "Ford RS 200 (this is the car involved in The accident at Rally Portugal)"}

At some point over the years, the business became a junkyard.  As the decades went by, they kept adding more cars (over 4,000) and expanded to 34 acres.  At some point, they realized they were better off as a tourist attraction than a junkyard.  They offer the chance to see classic car relics up through the 70s.\n\nI didn't even know this place existed when I drove past it.  They were already closed for the day.  I didn't even realize it was a tourist destination when I stopped, as I just wanted to take a picture of their fence, which had their name spelled out in hubcaps.  According to their website, they have two different admission prices, depending on whether or not you're going to bring a camera.  $25 if you are going to take photos and $15 if you are not. <a href=\"http://oldcarcityusa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oldcarcityusa.com/</a>", "title": "Old Car City, USA - White, GA"}, "id": "16322353072", "title": "Old Car City, USA - White, GA"}

The CCX is in many aspects a new car since it has been re-engineered to comply with the US regulation and market demands. Still, it has been a key issue for the Koenigsegg Team to keep the distinctive and record breaking CC shape. We believe it is important to avoid trends and instead hone the aerodynamic shape of the CC range for the future, only enhancing its unique look and appearance with tighter lines and a more aggressive stance. We also believe in continuity.  \n\nAUS NSW Darling Harbour Swedish Sports Car DSC02654  See where this photo was taken at <a href=\"http://maps.yuan.cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.yuan.cc</a>.", "title": "A Swedish Sports Car"}, "id": "124131510", "title": "A Swedish Sports Car"}

It was offered both in Coupe and Spyder form. 830 coupes and 120 Spyders were built in total. Maggiora of Turin supplied both bodies under contract.\n\nThe Mistral is the last model from the &quot;Casa del Tridente&quot; or \u201cHouse of the Trident\u201d to have the famous straight six cylinder, twin-spark, double overhead cam engine, as fitted to the Maserati 250F Grand Prix cars that won 8 Grand Prix between 1954 and 1960 and one F1 World Championship in 1957 driven by Juan Manuel Fangio. The engine also featured hemispherical combustion chambers and was fed by a Lucas indirect fuel injection system which was novelty at the time for Italian car manufacturers. Although the Lucas fuel injection system enhances performance, quite a few owners, especially in the U.S. have converted their cars to Weber carburetors due to difficulties in tuning the system properly. Maserati subsequently moved on to V8 engines for their later production cars. There were three engine variants fitted to the Mistral; 3500, 3700 and 4,000 cc. The most sought after derivative is the 4000 cc model. Only the earliest of the Mistrals were equipped with the 3500 cc engine. Unusually, the body was offered in both aluminum and steel but no one is quite sure as to how many of each were built. Use of the aluminum body panels had no effect on the performance of the Mistral. The mixture of the aluminum body on a steel substructure can lead to corrosion due to the dissimilar metals. The automobile was standard with a five speed transmission from ZF and also had four wheel solid disc brakes. As was Maserati's practice at the time the front suspension was independent while the rear made do with a solid axle. Speed for the 3.7 liter engine and the 4.0 liter engine was around 7 seconds or a little better and the top speed was around 140 mph (225 km/h) to 145 mph (233 km/h). When leaving the factory the Maserati Mistral originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).\n\nThe body which had been designed by Pietro Frua was first shown in a preview at the Salone Internazionale dell'Automobile di Torino in November 1963. The Maserati Mistral is generally considered as one of the most beautiful Maserati of all time. It is also often confused to the very similar looking but larger and more powerful AC Frua, which was a Frua design as well.", "title": "Maserati Mistrale"}, "id": "13926158833", "title": "Maserati Mistrale"}

My dad told me about someone who lived in mining town north of the city called Wawa and that every now and then would drive down to the city in a Bugatti, I did not believe him for a while until I saw this Rolls Royce, and got to speak with the owner who said that they were from Wawa.

This is made from only one exposure since I didn't use a tripod, I opened the RAW file in Photomatix Pro and tone mapped it to my liking. I then used ACR to polish up the 16 bit TIFF and opened it in CS4 where I cloned out some distracting elements, burned the ground darker, and cropped the image slightly.\n\nLarge: <a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=4483015888&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On Black</a>\n\n<b>EXPLORED!</b>", "title": "Rolls Royce Phantom"}, "id": "4483015888", "title": "Rolls Royce Phantom"}

It was designed by Dante Giacosa.\n\nTo meet the demands of the post-war market which called for economy cars, the Fiat 500 was rear-engined on the pattern of the Volkswagen Beetle. Several car makers followed this now nearly vanished pattern at the time and were quite successful, but only the Fiat 500 was used as the pattern for other car makers in Europe. The firms Neckar of Germany and Steyr-Puch in Austria each made cars that were legally based on the Fiat 500.\n\nDespite its diminutive size, the 500 proved to be an enormously practical and popular vehicle throughout Europe. Besides the two-door coupe\u0301, it was also available as the &quot;Giardiniera&quot; station wagon; this variant featured the standard engine laid on its side, the wheelbase lengthened by 10 cm (4 in) which yielded a usable rear seat, a full-length sunroof, and larger brakes from the Fiat 600.\n\nProduction of the 500 ended in 1975, although its replacement, the Fiat 126, was launched two years earlier. The 126 was never as popular as its predecessor in Italy, but was (and still is) enormously popular in the former Eastern Bloc countries, where it is famed for mechanical durability and economy.\n\nLaunched as the Nuova 500, it was marketed as a cheap and practical town car to combat high levels of congestion in Italian cities. Measuring only 2.97 m (9 ft 9 in) long, and originally powered by a tiny 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the 500 redefined the term &quot;small car&quot; and is considered one of the first city cars.", "title": "Fiat cinquecento"}, "id": "1117672608", "title": "Fiat cinquecento"}

Seen from the side this car is a teardrop shape, and very long. I could not get a good side-long shot. Here's the low-down on the car, which was built mid 20th century in my home town of Victoria, BC. 5x HDRi\n\n<strong>Museum displays home-grown car</strong>\n \nPedro Arrais\nTimes Colonist\n\nFriday, September 19, 2008\n\nA piece of British Columbia history rolled into the lobby of the Royal British Columbia Museum last week. The Spirit of Tomorrow is a one-of-a-kind car designed in B.C by Victoria resident H.B &quot;Barney&quot; Oldfield and assembled with the help of J.H. Norton between 1938 and 1942.\n\nThe car is on loan to the museum as part of its Free Spirit: Stories of You, Me and B.C. project that celebrates the 150th anniversary of British Columbia. Some people might remember the car when it was last displayed at Expo 86.\n\n&quot;There are few cars actually built in B.C.,&quot; says Lorne Hammond, curator of History at the museum. &quot;This car is noteworthy because of the aerodynamic, mid-engined design inspired by Oldfield's aviation background.&quot;\n\nThe car consists of an aluminum skin stretched over a wood body built on a 1939 Dodge car frame. As there were no wind tunnels to test the aerodynamic shape, Oldfield repeatedly dipped a scale model of the vehicle in a nearby creek. He streamlined the design by studying the water ripples the model caused in the current.\n\nThe engine is placed just in front of the rear wheels for better handling. It originally had a flat-head V-8 Ford engine but that was replaced by a modern 289 Ford V-8 when Oldfield restored the vehicle in 1967. Although the car weighs 1,400 kg it can attain a top speed of 180 km/h. At one time the rear of the car sported a fin for stability.\n\nThe design of the teardrop-shaped car is similar to the well-known Buckminster Fuller Dymaxion car of the same era. The main difference was the Dymaxion only had one wheel in the rear, which also steered the car.\n\nUnlike many prototypes, Oldfield's car has been road-licensed for the last 60 years and has transported the family on many road trips. It seats five.\n\nThe Spirit of Tomorrow will be on display at the RBCM until January 11, 2009.\n\nparrais@tc.canwest.com\n\u00a9 Times Colonist (Victoria) 2008", "title": "The Spirit of Tomorrow"}, "id": "2970416317", "title": "The Spirit of Tomorrow"}

Seen from the side this car is a teardrop shape, and very long. I could not get a good side-long shot. Here's the low-down on the car, which was built mid 20th century in my home town of Victoria, BC. 5x HDRi\n\n<strong>Museum displays home-grown car</strong>\n \nPedro Arrais\nTimes Colonist\n\nFriday, September 19, 2008\n\nA piece of British Columbia history rolled into the lobby of the Royal British Columbia Museum last week. The Spirit of Tomorrow is a one-of-a-kind car designed in B.C by Victoria resident H.B &quot;Barney&quot; Oldfield and assembled with the help of J.H. Norton between 1938 and 1942.\n\nThe car is on loan to the museum as part of its Free Spirit: Stories of You, Me and B.C. project that celebrates the 150th anniversary of British Columbia. Some people might remember the car when it was last displayed at Expo 86.\n\n&quot;There are few cars actually built in B.C.,&quot; says Lorne Hammond, curator of History at the museum. &quot;This car is noteworthy because of the aerodynamic, mid-engined design inspired by Oldfield's aviation background.&quot;\n\nThe car consists of an aluminum skin stretched over a wood body built on a 1939 Dodge car frame. As there were no wind tunnels to test the aerodynamic shape, Oldfield repeatedly dipped a scale model of the vehicle in a nearby creek. He streamlined the design by studying the water ripples the model caused in the current.\n\nThe engine is placed just in front of the rear wheels for better handling. It originally had a flat-head V-8 Ford engine but that was replaced by a modern 289 Ford V-8 when Oldfield restored the vehicle in 1967. Although the car weighs 1,400 kg it can attain a top speed of 180 km/h. At one time the rear of the car sported a fin for stability.\n\nThe design of the teardrop-shaped car is similar to the well-known Buckminster Fuller Dymaxion car of the same era. The main difference was the Dymaxion only had one wheel in the rear, which also steered the car.\n\nUnlike many prototypes, Oldfield's car has been road-licensed for the last 60 years and has transported the family on many road trips. It seats five.\n\nThe Spirit of Tomorrow will be on display at the RBCM until January 11, 2009.\n\nparrais@tc.canwest.com\n\u00a9 Times Colonist (Victoria) 2008", "title": "The Spirit of Tomorrow"}, "id": "2970416317", "title": "The Spirit of Tomorrow"}
