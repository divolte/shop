The main body was completed in only 38 years, from 1220 to 1258.\n \nThe cathedral has the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom (123m/404 ft). Visitors can take the &quot;Tower Tour&quot; where the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wood scaffolding, can be viewed. The cathedral also has the largest cloister and the largest cathedral close in Britain (80 acres (320,000 m2)). The cathedral contains the world's oldest working clock (from AD 1386) and has the best surviving of the four original copies of the Magna Carta (all four original copies are in England). Although commonly known as Salisbury Cathedral, the official name is the Cathedral of Saint Mary. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration in 1258.\n \nThe cathedral is the Mother Church of the Diocese of Salisbury and seat of the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nick Holtam.\n \nAs a response to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum, the decision was taken to resite the cathedral and the bishopric was moved to its present place in Salisbury. The move occurred during the tenure of Bishop Richard Poore, who was a wealthy man and donated the new land for construction. The new cathedral was also paid for by donations, principally by all the canons and vicars of South East England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until its completion. Legend has it that the Bishop of Old Sarum shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer and the deer finally died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now.\n \nThe foundation stone was laid on 28 April 1220. Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from Teffont Evias quarries. Due to the high water table in the new location, the cathedral was built on only four feet of foundations, and by 1258 the nave, transepts and choir were complete. The west front was ready by 1265. The cloisters and chapter house were completed around 1280. Because the cathedral was built in only 38 years, it has a single consistent architectural style, Early English Gothic.\n \nThe only major sections of the cathedral built later were the cloisters, chapter house, tower and spire, which at 404 feet (123 m) dominated the skyline from 1320. Although the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has also proved to be troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,397 tons (6,500 tonnes) to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on later great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury remains the tallest church spire in the UK. To this day the large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, arrested further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling, installed below the lantern stage of the tower.\n \nSignificant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of the bell tower which stood about 320 feet (100 m) north west of the main building. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral. However it does strike the time every 15 minutes with bells.\n\nFor further information please visit \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral</a> and <a href=\"http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php</a>", "tags": ["salisburycathedral", "cathedral", "salisbury", "church", "cathedralchurchoftheblessedvirginmary", "anglican", "earlyenglisharchitecture", "abigfave", "magicmomentsinyourlifelevel1", "magicmomentsinyourlifelevel2", "mygearandme", "saariysqualitypictures", "flickrstruereflection1", "flickrstruereflection2", "flickrstruereflection3", "magicmomentsinyourlifelevel3", "magicmomentsinyourlifelevel4", "greatshotss", "rememberthatmomentlevel1", "rememberthatmomentlevel2", "rememberthatmomentlevel3", "rememberthatmomentlevel4"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Magnificent Example of Early English Architecture With Vaulting Ambitions!"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Magnificent Example of Early English Architecture With Vaulting Ambitions!"}

The main body was completed in only 38 years, from 1220 to 1258.\n \nThe cathedral has the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom (123m/404 ft). Visitors can take the &quot;Tower Tour&quot; where the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wood scaffolding, can be viewed. The cathedral also has the largest cloister and the largest cathedral close in Britain (80 acres (320,000 m2)). The cathedral contains the world's oldest working clock (from AD 1386) and has the best surviving of the four original copies of the Magna Carta (all four original copies are in England). Although commonly known as Salisbury Cathedral, the official name is the Cathedral of Saint Mary. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration in 1258.\n \nThe cathedral is the Mother Church of the Diocese of Salisbury and seat of the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nick Holtam.\n \nAs a response to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum, the decision was taken to resite the cathedral and the bishopric was moved to its present place in Salisbury. The move occurred during the tenure of Bishop Richard Poore, who was a wealthy man and donated the new land for construction. The new cathedral was also paid for by donations, principally by all the canons and vicars of South East England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until its completion. Legend has it that the Bishop of Old Sarum shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer and the deer finally died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now.\n \nThe foundation stone was laid on 28 April 1220. Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from Teffont Evias quarries. Due to the high water table in the new location, the cathedral was built on only four feet of foundations, and by 1258 the nave, transepts and choir were complete. The west front was ready by 1265. The cloisters and chapter house were completed around 1280. Because the cathedral was built in only 38 years, it has a single consistent architectural style, Early English Gothic.\n \nThe only major sections of the cathedral built later were the cloisters, chapter house, tower and spire, which at 404 feet (123 m) dominated the skyline from 1320. Although the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has also proved to be troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,397 tons (6,500 tonnes) to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on later great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury remains the tallest church spire in the UK. To this day the large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, arrested further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling, installed below the lantern stage of the tower.\n \nSignificant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of the bell tower which stood about 320 feet (100 m) north west of the main building. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral. However it does strike the time every 15 minutes with bells.\n\nFor further information please visit \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral</a> and <a href=\"http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php</a> \n\nCreated with <a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">fd's Flickr Toys</a>", "tags": ["fdsflickrtoys", "salisburycathedral", "cathedral", "stainedglasswindows", "earlyenglisharchitecture", "cathedralchurchoftheblessedvirginmary", "anglican", "christianity", "middleages", "anticando", "flickrcolour", "colorsinourworld", "colorfullaward"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Top Glass Example of Early English Architecture!"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Top Glass Example of Early English Architecture!"}

The palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the Republic of Venice, opening as a museum in 1923. Today it is one of the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia system. In 2010 it was visited by 1.358.186 people.\nIn 810, Doge Angelo Partecipazio moved the seat of government from the island of Malamocco to the area of the present-day Rialto, when it was decided a palatium duci, a ducal palace, should be built. However, no traces remains of that 9th century building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172-1178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the St. Mark's Square. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one fa\u00e7ade to the Piazzeta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. \n\nAlthough only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone-pattern brick paving. Political changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace's structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council's members. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing moslty on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424, did Doge Francesco Foscari decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the fa\u00e7ade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442). In 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge's Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was comissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new Renaissance language to the building's architecture. \n\nAn entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia, with the official rooms of the government decorated with works comissioned from Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Another huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Reurbishment works were being held at the palace when on 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original Gothic style, despite the submission of a neo-classical alternative designs by the influential Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. However, there are some classical features \u2014 for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the Bridge of Sighs. As well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subejcted first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 it became part of Italy. \n\nOver this period, the palace as occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city. By the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which comes under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.\n\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge's_Palace,_Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge%27s_Palace,_Venice</a> \n\nVenice (Italian: Venezia [ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja] ( listen), Venetian: Venexia [ve\u02c8n\u025bsja]) is a city in northeast Italy which is renowned for the beauty of its setting, its architecture and its artworks. It is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.\n\nThe city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers.\n\nThe Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, and spice) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice</a> for further information...", "tags": ["dogespalace", "venice", "ceiling", "perspective", "palace", "archway", "columns", "architecture", "italy", "\u651d\u5f71\u767c\u71d2\u53cb", "vividstriking", "soe", "flickrstruereflection1", "anticando", "flickrstruereflection2", "flickrstruereflection3", "mygearandme"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Venice - Man's Ambition Had No Ceiling in the Doge's Palace!"}, "title": "Venice - Man's Ambition Had No Ceiling in the Doge's Palace!"}

The main body was completed in only 38 years, from 1220 to 1258.\n \nThe cathedral has the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom (123m/404 ft). Visitors can take the &quot;Tower Tour&quot; where the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wood scaffolding, can be viewed. The cathedral also has the largest cloister and the largest cathedral close in Britain (80 acres (320,000 m2)). The cathedral contains the world's oldest working clock (from AD 1386) and has the best surviving of the four original copies of the Magna Carta (all four original copies are in England). Although commonly known as Salisbury Cathedral, the official name is the Cathedral of Saint Mary. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration in 1258.\n \nThe cathedral is the Mother Church of the Diocese of Salisbury and seat of the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nick Holtam.\n \nAs a response to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum, the decision was taken to resite the cathedral and the bishopric was moved to its present place in Salisbury. The move occurred during the tenure of Bishop Richard Poore, who was a wealthy man and donated the new land for construction. The new cathedral was also paid for by donations, principally by all the canons and vicars of South East England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until its completion. Legend has it that the Bishop of Old Sarum shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer and the deer finally died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now.\n \nThe foundation stone was laid on 28 April 1220. Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from Teffont Evias quarries. Due to the high water table in the new location, the cathedral was built on only four feet of foundations, and by 1258 the nave, transepts and choir were complete. The west front was ready by 1265. The cloisters and chapter house were completed around 1280. Because the cathedral was built in only 38 years, it has a single consistent architectural style, Early English Gothic.\n \nThe only major sections of the cathedral built later were the cloisters, chapter house, tower and spire, which at 404 feet (123 m) dominated the skyline from 1320. Although the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has also proved to be troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,397 tons (6,500 tonnes) to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on later great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury remains the tallest church spire in the UK. To this day the large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, arrested further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling, installed below the lantern stage of the tower.\n \nSignificant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of the bell tower which stood about 320 feet (100 m) north west of the main building. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral. However it does strike the time every 15 minutes with bells.\n\nFor further information please visit \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral</a> and <a href=\"http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.php</a>", "tags": ["salisburycathedral", "cathedral", "church", "cathedralchurchoftheblessedvirginmary", "anglican", "earlyenglisharchitecture", "architecture", "gothicarchitecture", "ceiling", "vaultedceiling", "rhizome", "thegalaxy", "anticando", "middleages", "mygearandme", "saariysqualitypictures", "creativephotocafe", "vigilantphotographersunite", "vpu2", "vpu3", "vpu4", "vpu5", "vpu6", "vpu7", "vpu8", "vpu9", "vpu10", "rememberthatmomentlevel1", "rememberthatmomentlevel2"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Magnificent Building That Throws You More Than One Curve!"}, "title": "Salisbury Cathedral - A Magnificent Building That Throws You More Than One Curve!"}

I also like how the HDR has made the ends of the passage ways dark as it makes it look very mysterious and interesting.\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.jhimages.co.uk/Architecture/HDR/25312382_nsp35G#!i=2080512667&amp;k=THTTXGx&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here if you would like to purchase this image as a print or as a digital download.</a></b>", "tags": ["united", "uk", "tonemapped", "symmetry", "processing", "photomartix", "photography", "norwich", "nikon", "nikkor", "hdr", "england", "cathedral", "architecture", "1024", "photomatrix", "raw", "photoshop", "light", "art", "d300", "exposure", "lightroom", "colour", "photo", "travel", "wide", "landscape", "i2080512667ampkthttxgxamplb1ampsa", "digital", "blending", "blendingdynamic", "range", "increasedri", "dri"], "owner": {"username": "JH Images.co.uk", "id": "7676405@N04", "realname": ""}, "title": "Which Way..."}, "title": "Which Way..."}

I don't know if I am lame for going to bed early then waking up at 6 AM to catch an early train to a city to explore, but that's okay with me. Just me and my ipod and my camera... \n\nI've been completely blown away by Dresden. It was recommended to me by a few friends and after spending the day there, I have to say that it compares closely to some of my best photography days around Italy or France. The Baroque architecture is stunning and it is completely unique and charming.\n\nI'm off to Ukraine next...   Aeroflot here I come.  I hope the mechanic does not come down the aisle again making a collection to buy a part for the plane.

Originally the home of one of Northern California's first major lumber barons, it has housed the Ingomar Club, a private members only club, since 1950.

The palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the Republic of Venice, opening as a museum in 1923. Today it is one of the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia system. In 2010 it was visited by 1.358.186 people.\nIn 810, Doge Angelo Partecipazio moved the seat of government from the island of Malamocco to the area of the present-day Rialto, when it was decided a palatium duci, a ducal palace, should be built. However, no traces remains of that 9th century building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172-1178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the St. Mark's Square. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one fa\u00e7ade to the Piazzeta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. \n\nAlthough only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone-pattern brick paving. Political changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace's structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council's members. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing moslty on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424, did Doge Francesco Foscari decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the fa\u00e7ade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442). In 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge's Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was comissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new Renaissance language to the building's architecture. \n\nAn entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia, with the official rooms of the government decorated with works comissioned from Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Another huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Reurbishment works were being held at the palace when on 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original Gothic style, despite the submission of a neo-classical alternative designs by the influential Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. However, there are some classical features \u2014 for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the Bridge of Sighs. As well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subejcted first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 it became part of Italy. \n\nOver this period, the palace as occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city. By the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which comes under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.\n\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge's_Palace,_Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge%27s_Palace,_Venice</a> \n\nVenice (Italian: Venezia [ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja] ( listen), Venetian: Venexia [ve\u02c8n\u025bsja]) is a city in northeast Italy which is renowned for the beauty of its setting, its architecture and its artworks. It is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.\n\nThe city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers.\n\nThe Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, and spice) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice</a> for further information...", "tags": ["venice", "doge", "dogespalace", "palace", "italy", "building", "architecture", "anawesomeshot", "amiamoci", "flickrstruereflection1", "castlespalacesmanorhousesstatelyhomescottages", "clear", "day"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Venice - Light and Shade Inside the Doge's Palace"}, "title": "Venice - Light and Shade Inside the Doge's Palace"}

It is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.\n\nThe city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers.\n\nThe Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, and spice) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice</a> for further information...", "tags": ["venice", "windows", "architecture", "adriaticadinavigazionespa", "italy", "virtualjourney", "abigfave"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "More Than One Window into the Adriatica di Navigazione S.p.A.!"}, "title": "More Than One Window into the Adriatica di Navigazione S.p.A.!"}

I showed up, at the very last possible second, and then said hi to everyone.  It was a very upbeat crowd, and I was happy to meet all of them!  I think we had around 50 there, even though the rain was rather epic, especially by California standards!\n\nAfter I explained the way I do my Photowalks (half shooting, half sharing online), we set out to hit a few spots on campus.  As we were moving about, Arnav Moudgil took <a href=\"http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/02/05/strolling-for-photos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this photo</a> (also on the right) for the newspaper.  This was taken when we were walking in one of the covered areas of the campus.\n\nWe moved around and hit several locations, including the one below.  At the end, we went over to an eating area and talked for a long while about photography and stuff!  I signed books, gave away all kinds of goodies from Smugmug, and this sort of thing -- it was nice to meet such enthusiastic photographers.  One enterprising Type A created a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1302258@N25/\">Stuck In Stanford</a>&quot; Flickr group where people are currently sharing their photos... this is my first contribution to the group!\n\n\nDaily Photo - The Stanford Church in the Photowalk Storm\n\nThe rain situation was betwixt sprinkles and torrent.  There was enough rain to moisten my bulbous 12-24 (that sounds dirty), so I wanted to be quick.  Usually, I let people look through my lens to see the composition, but, it would have gotten too wet... so I just fired away quickly then put on my little trombone-cover-thing.\n\nNow, maybe my smart audience can help me figure this out.  Some people on the walk told me that &quot;HDR&quot; was &quot;invented&quot; here at Stanford.  Others tell me MIT.  A few people told me that the first HDRs ever taken were inside this very church (where I also collected some shots, for publication soon).  Anyway, this all sounds very intriguing... and I am interested to know the real answers!\n\nfrom the blog <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a>", "tags": ["stanford", "hdr", "california", "paloalto", "stuckincustoms", "trey", "ratcliff", "stuck", "customs", "blog", "photography", "high", "dynamic", "range", "digital", "imaging", "travelblog", "nikon", "d3x", "color", "travel", "north", "america", "united", "states", "usa", "west", "coast", "pacific", "church", "photowalk", "storm", "sky", "clouds", "turbulent", "religion", "moody", "facade", "fa\u00e7ade", "stormy", "dramatic", "angels", "hope", "faith", "worship", "spiritual", "jose", "san", "palo", "alto", "february", "2010", "glorious", "memorial", "memchu", "university", "campus", "romanesque", "byzantine", "stained", "glass", "window", "mosaic", "nondenominational", "architecture", "design", "charles", "coolidge", "angel", "icon", "cross", "prayer"], "owner": {"username": "Stuck in Customs", "id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff"}, "title": "The Stanford Church in the Photowalk Storm"}, "title": "The Stanford Church in the Photowalk Storm"}

But I had no such key so I was forced to stay on the perimeter with all the other heathens. \n\nfrom my daily photo blog at <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a>", "tags": ["paris", "france", "french", "la", "basilique", "du", "sacre", "coeur", "de", "montmatre", "jesuit", "jesuits", "christians", "church", "basilica", "religion", "travel", "trey", "ratcliff", "treyratcliff", "beautiful", "pretty", "colorful", "fresh", "dream", "photo", "photograph", "photography", "professional", "technique", "dynamic", "world", "fabulous", "gorgeous", "engaging", "charming", "stunning", "art", "artisitic", "divine", "light", "foreign", "international", "holy", "chapel", "curtissimmons", "stuckincustoms", "hdr", "travelphotography", "adventure", "hdrtutorial", "tutorial", "blue", "gree", "sky", "colors", "montmarte", "top100", "sacr\u00e9c\u0153ur", "sacr\u00e9", "c\u0153ur", "sacred", "dome", "fence", "2007", "cathedral", "architecture"], "owner": {"username": "Stuck in Customs", "id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff"}, "title": "La Basilique du Sacre Coeur de Montmartre"}, "title": "La Basilique du Sacre Coeur de Montmartre"}

Built in 1907 and expanded from 1923-32, it was closed during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution periods, and turned into a museum in 1997.\n\nThe church stands 53.3 meters (175 ft) tall, occupies an area of 721 square meters (0.18 acres), and is the perfect example of Neo-Byzantine architecture. The main structure is laid out like a cross with the main hall topped with a huge green tipped dome. Under the bright sun, the church and the square area it lies on looks quite like the Red Square in Moscow.\n\nPictured is the view of the church from its side, where pigeons gather around its facade.

Yet, one day I saw a photo with many similarities to this one, and thus began my quest.  There did not seem to be any building or balcony, even if it was open to the public, that would give this view.  And I was very sure it was not taken from an aircraft of any sort too.  In addition, buildings look very different at ground level than they do from on high, so I was having trouble just identifying other buildings.  \n\nLater I saw a similar photo with a second building I could identify.  Locally it's known as the Castle of Richard the Lion-hearted.  (It's not shown in this photo).  Now I could identify the general direction that someone had pointed their camera.  Next time here, I found a set of steps going up a hill, an old set of wooden steps with about 5% of them broken in half and another 20% soon to break through.  But no luck.  The photo was not taken from here.  I did see another set of steps on the other side of the street, but for some reason I did not believe these would lead anywhere useful.  And it didn't seem nearly high enough to get a similar photo.  \n\nBut back to Google Earth, and lining up the two buildings I decided that those second set of steps just might lead me to my quest.  I went back a week later and climbed those steps and got this view, and a few more equally as awesome.  \n\n\n<b>Thoughts | Comments | Critiques | Questions ~ Always Welcome</b>\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<b>by Matt Shalvatis - Roads Less Traveled Photography</b>\nPersonal Sites: <a href=\"http://roadslesstraveledphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website </a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/roads.less.traveled.photography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MattShalvatis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102239645172983099492/posts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google+</a>\nContributor to:  <a href=\"http://www.hdrspotting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HDR Spotting </a> | <a href=\"http://hdrphotog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HDR Photog </a> | <a href=\"http://topazmasters.posterous.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Topaz Masters </a>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattsh/collections/72157623690434215/\">~~ Top Sets @ Flickr ~~</a>\n&nbsp;", "tags": ["architecture", "kiev", "kyiv", "blue", "building", "capital", "christian", "christianity", "church", "city", "classical", "colorful", "cross", "culture", "cupola", "dome", "downtown", "europe", "european", "exterior", "famous", "gold", "hill", "historic", "historical", "history", "house", "landmark", "medieval", "old", "orthodox", "popular", "religion", "saint", "sight", "sky", "standrews", "timeless", "tourism", "tower", "town", "tree", "ukraine", "ukrainian", "mattshalvatis"], "owner": {"username": "Matt.

I have heard the perpendicular style, the english term for late gothic architecture, called <i>inferior</i> to what came before it, but inferior was not the first word to cross my mind as we entered the chapel and spent some time there by ourselves before other tourists arrived.\n\nyes, if you judge it strictly by the defining categories of gothic architecture set up by ruskin, you'll find it lacking. here is little of the savageness, the changefulness or variety, the naturalism, or the sense of the grotesque he described. in fact, ruskin called the chapel a table turned upside down with its four legs in the air, an acute image of its less celebrated exterior, but he also admitted elsewhere that his attack <i>&quot;took no account...of its superiority to everything else in its style&quot;</i>.\n\none underlying aspect of mediaeval architecture was an ambition of the church to match the classical monuments it had grown up among, the very monuments it had torn down in its early, taliban days but not quite erased from history. several surviving texts ask the same nagging question: how could pagan romans outshine the righteous?\n\nabbot suger who had been instrumental in the very birth of gothic at st. denis - he also wrote a book with the unpromising title <i>the deeds of louis the fat</i> - claimed success in his memoirs in which a traveller brought the happy message that st. denis had superseded even the roman hagia sophia in constantinople. in itself, a learned echo of justinian's &quot;O solomon, I have outdone thee&quot; when <i>he</i> saw hagia sophia completed, but...suffice to say, either the traveller or the abbot was a liar.\n\nepochs of architecture show such different qualities and priorities that they can be difficult to compare (or indeed to supersede, mr. suger) yet with the gothic, invitations to compare abound. monastries and cathedrals were built as fragments of an ideal city, but looking at their atriums, octagons, and basilicas, they are clearly fragments of an idealized rome, not some abstract city of god. now imagine them as they were intended, full of men wearing dresses, speaking latin, collecting art and books, hoarding wealth, burning incense, and buggering choirboys. I know, I know. its classical.\n\nand so is king's college chapel, all order, repetition and symmetry. those vaults, those spectacular fan vaults, are a great physical presence in the space, not some distant gothic apparition. to my mind, it is as classical as anything the renaissance produced in britain. no wonder, ruskin had to dismiss it. romans would feel right at home here, though they would not hesitate to replace that silly organ with a pool and install underfloor heating. it is never too late, one might add as a note to the locals.\n\non a more serious note, king's college chapel is the finest building in cambridge and the real reason we went there. built by four master masons or architects over almost a century (if you include the stained glass windows), its unity of design is striking. it was the end of gothic, but it doesn't look like the end of anything. if we had only managed to see that one house, our trip to england would still have been justified. just go.\n\nautostitch of several photos.\n\n<i>this photo was uploaded with a CC license and may be used free of charge and in any way you see fit. \nif possible, please name photographer &quot;SEIER+SEIER&quot;. \nif not, don't.</i>", "tags": ["kingscollegechapel", "kings", "college", "chapel", "cambridge", "cambridgeshire", "england", "great", "britain", "uk", "church", "perpendicular", "style", "late", "gothic", "gotik", "fan", "vault", "fanvault", "stone", "vaulting", "reginaldely", "johnwastell", "simonclerk", "williamvertue", "stained", "glass", "windows", "architecture", "arquitectura", "architektur", "arquitetura", "architectuur", "architettura", "tudor", "renaissance", "organ", "wood", "screen", "wall", "seierseier", "creative", "commons", "cc"], "owner": {"username": "seier+seier", "id": "94852245@N00", "realname": ""}, "title": "king's college chapel, cambridge 1446-1515."}, "title": "king's college chapel, cambridge 1446-1515."}

So finally I found some time to take a set of shot over a view hours and process then. The 5th release shows the following buildings: Piano-Hochhaus (on the left side with 79 Meter), Kollhoff-Tower (in the middl with 101 Meter) and the Bahntower (on the right side with 103 Meter).

According to a less popular theory, its model was the 13-domed oaken Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (ca. 989), which Yaroslav I the Wise determined to imitate in stone as a sign of gratitude to the citizens of Novgorod who had helped him secure the Kievan throne in 1019.\n\u2026..\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917 and during the Soviet antireligious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral\u2019s destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park \u201cHeroes of Perekop\u201d (after a Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War in Crimea). The cathedral was saved from destruction primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, Soviet authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding seventeenth\u2013eighteenth century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Sophia_Cathedral_in_Kiev\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Sophia_Cathedral_in_Kiev</a>\n\nIt's still an architectural and historical museum today, since three different denominations are laying claim to this property.\n\n<b>Thoughts | Comments | Critiques | Questions ~ Always Welcome</b>\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<b>by Matt Shalvatis - Roads Less Traveled Photography</b>\nPersonal Sites: <a href=\"http://roadslesstraveledphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website </a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/roads.less.traveled.photography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MattShalvatis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>\nContributor to:  <a href=\"http://www.hdrspotting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HDR Spotting </a> | <a href=\"http://hdrphotog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HDR Photog </a> | <a href=\"http://topazmasters.posterous.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Topaz Masters </a>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattsh/collections/72157623690434215/\">400+ Views &amp; Other Sets @ Flickr</a>\n&nbsp;", "tags": ["architecture", "clouds", "kiev", "kyiv", "sunny", "autumn", "beautiful", "blue", "building", "capital", "cathedral", "christianity", "church", "cross", "cupola", "day", "dome", "europe", "famous", "golden", "green", "hdr", "history", "landmark", "landscape", "monastery", "orthodox", "outdoor", "religion", "scene", "spirituality", "stsophia", "tourist", "town", "travel", "tree", "ukraine", "ukrainian", "unescoworldheritagesite", "view", "white", "gettycentraleurope2", "mattshalvatis"], "owner": {"username": "Matt.

We wanted to explore a new country and Bucharest sure sounded interesting. When I booked the tickets I didn\u2019t know much about Romania, but a short look in the history on Wikipedia increased my pleasant anticipation. Ceausescu\u2019s dictatorship must have been horrible but all those huge neoclassical buildings along the majestic boulevards are very impressive.\n\nAbove all is the Palace of the Parliament. It is the biggest civil building of the world and goes as deep into the ground as it goes up into the sky. An unimaginable network of corridors and only a few of them can be visited. The room on the photo is the Ballroom which is the biggest room of the palace. Directly behind me was a rolled up carpet which covers the whole floor. It is that huge, that it had to be knotted inside of the room, because it would have been too big and heavy to carry it in. Do you have an Idea how large the room is? 972m\u00b2!\n\nIf you fancy a nice wedding location: You can rent the room and for sure it offers enough space for the guests.\n\nRegarding the photo itself, I wished I could have spent more time there. Unfortunately you can only visit the Palace of the Parliament within a guided tour. I often fell behind to take some shots but the guide kept reminding me a hundred times that I have to stay in the group. Especially in this room I would have loved to work with a model, because I think the room alone does not display its dimension. Also I would have loved to use my tripod. But unfortunately they charge you a very decent amount for \u201cprofessional shootings\u201d to improve Bucharest\u2019s city treasury.\n\nMore information and camera settings at: <a href=\"http://sumfinity.com/2013/10/20/bucharests-palace-of-the-parliament-ballroom-romania/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sumfinity.com/2013/10/20/bucharests-palace-of-the-parliam...</a>\n\nAuf Deutsch: <a href=\"http://de.sumfinity.com/2013/10/20/bukarester-parlamentspalast-ballsaal-rumanien/\" rel=\"nofollow\">de.sumfinity.com/2013/10/20/bukarester-parlamentspalast-b...</a>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<a href=\"http://sumfinity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicoTrinkhaus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nicotrinkhaus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/nicotrinkhaus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinterest</a> | <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118078387188969068621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google +</a>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou're free to use my work on your private website, as long as you set a hyperlink to sumfinity.com and mention me, Nico Trinkhaus, as the author. <a href=\"http://sumfinity.com/copyright/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Check this for details on the copyright and licensing.</a>", "tags": ["palace", "palast", "parliament", "government", "romania", "rum\u00e4nien", "bucharest", "bucuresti", "bukarest", "palatulparlamentului", "hdr", "interior", "marmor", "marble", "reflections", "reflektionen", "ballroom", "ballsaal", "ball", "kronleuchter", "europe", "europa", "reflection", "travel", "reisen", "trinkhaus", "nicotrinkhaus", "sumfinity", "inside", "photomatix", "architecture", "architektur", "hdrphotography", "handheld", "lights", "lichter", "canon", "canon500d"], "owner": {"username": "NicoTrinkhaus", "id": "63817584@N03", "realname": "Nico Trinkhaus"}, "title": "Bucharest\u2019s Palace of the Parliament \u2013 Ballroom | Romania"}, "title": "Bucharest\u2019s Palace of the Parliament \u2013 Ballroom | Romania"}

The main campus is adjacent to Beyaz\u0131t Square, in Fatih.\nHISTORY:\nIt was founded as an institution of higher education named the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun (House of Multiple Sciences) on July 23, 1846; but the Medrese (Theological School) which was founded immediately after Mehmed II conquered (Istanbul) in 1453 is regarded as the precursor to the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun which evolved into Istanbul University.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople a madrasa, a religious school, was established.[1] Education began to be available in theological schools (&quot;medrese/madrasah&quot; as they were then called) and, until the end of the 19th century, these schools were instrumental in educating the ruling cadres of the Ottoman society. However, when the &quot;madrasahs&quot; were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called &quot;Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun,&quot; the core of Istanbul University, were established.\n\nAn institution of higher education named the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun-i Osmani ('House of Sciences') was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871.[1] Its first rector was Hasan Tahsini, regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century. In 1874 the Imperial University (Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun-i Sultani) started classes in law in French, but was closed in 1881.[1]\n\nThe Imperial University, now known as Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnun-i Shahane was refounded in 1900, with the departments of theology, arts, mathematics, science and philology.[1] In 1924, the faculties of law, medicine, arts and sciences were established in Istanbul University (Istanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcnunu), as the university was now called.[1] Islamic theology was added in 1925, but in 1933 the university was reorganized without the latter.[1]\n\nThe first modern Applied Physics courses were given at the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn on 31 December 1863, which marked the beginning of a new period, and on 20 February 1870, the school was renamed as the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u Osman\u00ee ('Ottoman House of Multiple Sciences') and reorganized to meet the needs of modern sciences and technologies. Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of Galatasaray High School, which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u \u015eahane ('Imperial House of Multiple Sciences') with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the \u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu ('Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences') while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the Republic of Turkey recognized the Istanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of Istanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu was recognized while the &quot;Schools&quot; (within the old Medrese system) became modern &quot;Faculties&quot;. On 1 August 1933, Istanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu was reorganized as Istanbul University (\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi) following the educational reforms of Atat\u00fcrk.

Los Mochis was the destination for the start of a 8 day trip through Mexico's Copper Canyon complex ending in Chihuahua, then on to Zihuatanejo, Guerrero for 2 weeks of beach time.\nSo we ended up in Mexico City at 5:30 am with 12 hours to spare before the flight from Mexico City to Los Mochis.\nWhat to do?  Been here before but one of our group of 4 had not so we jumped on the efficient easy to use (and crowded) subway from the airport to central Mexico City ($5.5 Pesos, one transfer).  Had breakfast at a nice restaurant off the Zocalo (El Cardenal), did a walking tour in Centro and then a Turibus &quot;Hop-on, Hop-off&quot; bus ride covering sites in the city centre area.  Mexico City is beautiful, full of old and new architectural gems and rife with public art, sculptures, monuments and museums (more than 150 museums,  second only to Paris).\n\nMETROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL- (Catedral Metropolitana)\nAt the historic heart of one of the world's most populous cities, is the first and largest cathedral in the Americas, seat of the Archdiocese of Mexico.   Construction and decoration of t cathedral, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, took nearly 3 centuries. Construction began in 1573, and the building was dedicated, although still unfinished, in 1656. The cathedral is host to a mixture of styles, a result of being built over such a long period of time.\nWithin its huge bulk are 16 chapels, several alters and retablos, a fine parish church, and a choir, each an inspired work of art replete with gold gilt, fine paintings, and sculptural details. Above it all, 25 bells - measured in tons - ring and sing to the city.\n\nThe cathedral sits atop a far more ancient foundation, originally built for a temple to Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec God of war. His pyramid was destroyed by the Spanish, who built their cathedral in its stead. As the thirsty city emptied its underground aquifer, however, this massive monument began to sink into the subsoil. It was stabilized in the 1990s, but still lists to one side.  Although restorers have been unable to halt the sinking altogether, they have corrected the tilting towers and ensured that the cathedral will now sink uniformly.\n\nThe Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral overlooks the Z\u00f3calo, more properly called Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, which has marked the city center since it was founded in 1325. Though the Spanish razed the neighborhood's original Aztec temples and federal buildings, they used the same stones to rebuild the capital city in Europe's image. Half a millennium later, this is still the center of all the action.\n\n\nSINKING BUILDING:\nThe cathedral, like many buildings in Mexico City, is gradually sinking into the ground. Various factors contribute to this problem:\n\n-The city's soft clay subsoil.\n-The considerable weight of the cathedral.\n-Uneven foundations, due to being built on top of prehispanic structures.\n\nRestoration work began in the 1990s have stabilized the building.\n\nThe interior of the cathedral is as impressive as its exterior, with many retablosdating from the 16th and 17th Centuries. One painting from the main altar that's particularly noteworthy is titled &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin.&quot; It was painted by Juan Rodriguez Juarez in 1726, and was recently restored.", "tags": ["2014", "mexico", "mexicocity", "tedmcgrath", "tedsphotos", "cathedral", "catedralmetropolitana", "church", "catholicchurch", "dome", "bells", "belltower", "zocalo", "mexicocityzocalo", "clock", "square", "people", "cropped", "vignetting", "nikon", "nikonfx", "d600", "d600fx", "streetscene", "street", "peopleandpaths", "domes", "churchdome", "clockface", "vehicles", "historic", "old", "oldandbeautiful", "oldbuilding", "historicbuilding", "architecture", "5photosaday"], "owner": {"username": "Ted's photos - For me & you", "id": "90955804@N04", "realname": "Ted McGrath"}, "title": "2014 - Mexico City - Cathedral"}, "title": "2014 - Mexico City - Cathedral"}

It is currently one of four architectural landmarks of Ukraine, which were put down on the List of Mankind Treasures of Five Continents by the world society.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew\u2019s_Church,_Kiev\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew\u2019s_Church,_Kiev</a>\n\n\n<b>Thoughts | Comments | Critiques | Questions ~ Always Welcome</b>\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<b>by Matt Shalvatis - Roads Less Traveled Photography</b>\n<a href=\"http://roadslesstraveledphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website </a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/roads.less.traveled.photography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MattShalvatis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattsh/collections/72157623690434215/\">200+ Views &amp; Other Sets @ Flickr</a>\n&nbsp;", "tags": ["architecture", "kiev", "kyiv", "people", "beautiful", "bell", "blue", "building", "cathedral", "christianity", "church", "city", "construction", "cross", "culture", "daytime", "europe", "exterior", "famous", "gold", "green", "historic", "history", "old", "ornate", "outdoors", "place", "religion", "scene", "sky", "standrew", "stairs", "style", "tourism", "tourist", "tower", "ukraine", "urban", "white", "winter", "gettycentraleurope2", "mattshalvatis"], "owner": {"username": "Matt.

The Minster is 148 metres long and each of its three towers are 60 metres high.

The further south you go in France, the more likely you are to find the old influence of the Spanish bullfights.  It's pretty violent, yes?  Yes.  In fact, if you zoom in, you can still see blood that has been smeared across the arena by the smearing-truck.\n\nOnce the crowd started to clear out, a perfect sunset settled upon us.  It was just Fabien, my wife, and I, and it was a very nice night.  After the bullfight, we walked around to take a lot of photos of this amazing evening, Fabien took us to his favorite little secret French restaurant down one of the side streets.

architecture of the central buildings impressed me enormously as a student, this was how I wanted to work. today, we hide away construction behind tons of insulation and cheap aluminium cladding, and architecture is only half the art it could be.\n\nin writing, st. catherine's college has been called everything from pure bauhaus to miesian minimalism, a motel and a hangar, without telling us much about this strange design and its origins. pevnser called it a piece of perfect architecture while reyner banham said that it offered no room for improvisation, no exploiting the happy accident. really, they were describing classicism from two different moral perspectives, two different generations.\n\nif we accept that jacobsen the modernist kept returning to the roots of his classicist training, he did so at different times and under the influence of different architects and so never arrived at the same place twice.\n\nteaching at the royal academy in copenhagen in the 1920's was conducted under the influence of carl petersen who had headed a classicist rebelion against the rampant individualism of the older generation. among the ideals were adherence to type, the perfection of which expressed the architect's sensitivity, and its endless repetition. make no mistake, endless repetition of an estabished type was never a modernist invention to do with machine fabrication; it was inhereted from the classicists and given new meaning.\n\nthe classicist fearlessness in the face of repetition was tempered by jacobsen's admiration for asplund who was considered the poet of the movement along with his partner in crime, sigurd lewerentz, and an architect of rarefied effects. not quite the example for all to follow, he was later hailed as.\n\njacobsen's first return to classicism, following his <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2671639969/in/set-72157600269237235/\">berlin-inspired</a> modern houses of the late twenties and early thirties, happened under the influence of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2786897431/in/set-72157600269237235/\">italian fascist architecture</a> and - again - asplund who had himself abandoned the constructivism of his 1930 stockholm exhibition in favour of his <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/493634251/\">very own take</a> on italian rationalism.\n\nthe second return came around 1950 when american glass box minimalism replaced jacobsen's <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2771643425/in/set-72157600269237235/\">gentle brick regionalism</a> of the forties. the very obvious references to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2648972590/in/set-72157600269237235/\">eero saarinen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2315569312/in/set-72157600269237235/\">S.O.M.</a>  may have secured jacobsen's name as a cool modernist at the time, but they also made him look like an epigone with a deft hand at furniture design, a view of jacobsen you can still meet, not least here in denmark.\n\nthe third, and to me most interesting, distinct period of classicism began around 1960. the main works are the national bank in copenhagen and st. catherine's college. they carried a level of repetition not seen since the 1920's and indeed some very rarefied effects like the extreme proportions of columns and beams and the way they project through glass. materially and geometrically, these projects are rich and they contain many cultural allusions, the most obvious being the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2439481234/in/set-72157600269237235/\">mirroring</a> of a nearby 18th century temple front in the national bank.\n\nthese late jacobsen buildings are related to contemporary works of stirling and the smithsons in their sophisticated and exploitive relationship to the history of modern architecture, indeed the whole history of architecture. it is worth remembering that such projects formed the architectural and intellectual context of the rise of post-modernism, it was never a strict diet of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruitt%e2%80%93Igoe\" rel=\"nofollow\">pruitt\u2013igoe</a> served on a tabula rasa...\n\nI am not going to try to turn jacobsen into a <i>team X</i> member, but his strong dislike of le corbusier had allowed him to escape some of the worst mistakes of the CIAM and to remain open to certain historical models when they proved viable, at oxford most noticably the &quot;new college&quot;, dating from 1379. after my first visit to st. catherine's back in the nineties, I asked knud holscher, who was made a partner by jacobsen to build st. catherine's and start a UK office, about influences. while this is clearly not a question easily answered, he did mention <i>craig ellwood</i> as someone staff members studied around 1960.\n\nin many ways, this makes perfect sense. jacobsen rarely made a straight reference to mies, rather he took his cues from what we might call <i>mies-once-removed</i>: people like bunschaft at S.O.M., saarinen, ellwood. the national bank and st. catherine's don't actually look anything like an ellwood building, so maybe the influence should be understood as something more general. ellwood, californian by choice, had relaxed the miesian standards, he would change infill materials in his steel bays more freely, he would allow steel bays to wander off and become garden elements. in short, as an example, he offered freedom.\n\ninterestingly, craig ellwood was later, much later, to influence renzo piano, <i>post-pompidou</i>, and once again in a liberating manner. considering that ellwood <i>never actually existed</i>, perhaps a liberating influence was to be expected. I'll devote the next few slides to ellwood and holscher before returning to oxford.\n\nmore <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/sets/72157600269237235/\">jacobsen</a>.", "tags": ["arnejacobsen", "arne", "jacobsen", "architect", "stcatherinescollege", "catz", "college", "oxford", "university", "library", "england", "architecture", "modern", "modernism", "arquitectura", "danish", "nordic", "scandinavian", "architektur", "arquitetura", "architectuur", "architettura", "landscaping", "quad", "classicism", "ovearup", "arup", "povlahm", "seierseier", "creative", "commons", "cc"], "owner": {"username": "seier+seier", "id": "94852245@N00", "realname": ""}, "title": "arne jacobsen, st. catherine's college, oxford 11"}, "title": "arne jacobsen, st. catherine's college, oxford 11"}

The palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the Republic of Venice, opening as a museum in 1923. Today it is one of the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia system. In 2010 it was visited by 1.358.186 people.\nIn 810, Doge Angelo Partecipazio moved the seat of government from the island of Malamocco to the area of the present-day Rialto, when it was decided a palatium duci, a ducal palace, should be built. However, no traces remains of that 9th century building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172-1178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the St. Mark's Square. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one fa\u00e7ade to the Piazzeta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. \n\nAlthough only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone-pattern brick paving. Political changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace's structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council's members. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing moslty on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424, did Doge Francesco Foscari decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the fa\u00e7ade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442). In 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge's Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was comissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new Renaissance language to the building's architecture. \n\nAn entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia, with the official rooms of the government decorated with works comissioned from Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Another huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Reurbishment works were being held at the palace when on 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original Gothic style, despite the submission of a neo-classical alternative designs by the influential Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. However, there are some classical features \u2014 for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the Bridge of Sighs. As well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subejcted first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 it became part of Italy. \n\nOver this period, the palace as occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city. By the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which comes under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.\n\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge's_Palace,_Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge%27s_Palace,_Venice</a> \n\nVenice (Italian: Venezia [ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja] ( listen), Venetian: Venexia [ve\u02c8n\u025bsja]) is a city in northeast Italy which is renowned for the beauty of its setting, its architecture and its artworks. It is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.\n\nThe city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers.\n\nThe Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, and spice) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice</a> for further information...", "tags": ["venice", "dogespalace", "ceiling", "stairs", "staircase", "palace", "italy", "mygearandme", "mygearandmepremium", "anticando", "noblearchitecture"], "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Venice - There's No Ceiling on Beauty in the Doge's Palace!"}, "title": "Venice - There's No Ceiling on Beauty in the Doge's Palace!"}

Please respect the photographer and his work.\n\nThe Outlaw Hunt House in Oxford, North Carolina, is a craftsman bungalow built in 1920. Outlaw Hunt was in his family\u2019s lumber business and his wife, Marie, was known locally for her portrait painting. The 1 1/2 story frame structure has end gables with a generous sweeping line towards the front and towards the rear. The porch and porte cochere are covered by the down slope of the high pitch roof. One chimney is visible, and a large gabled dormer of 4 fixed 9-light windows is on the front facade. Fenestration elsewhere appears to be 9/9 sash windows. The carport roof is an extension of that which covers the substantial wraparound porch. The porch roof is supported here by thick tapered posts with recessed panels, resting on large piers covered with some sort of masonry. Stone steps lead to the entry porch, but I neglected to pay attention to the entrance other than there are sidelights.

Can you figure out where I'm standing to take the image above in the image below? Read more about the tour, <a href=\"http://cjsmithphotography.com/2012/04/24/iowa-capitol-dome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In this shot, you are seeing the bottom half of the dome and the upper level of the capitol building. You can see down to the main floor. In the center of the main floor is the glass circle with an X across it, in which you can see through to the basement.<strong>Shooting HDR Handheld</strong>\nFor today's image (top), I couldn't position my tripod to put my camera in position to get this composition.  The only way I could do it was to reach my arms out over the railing and compose the image using live view on the camera LCD.  I usually shoot my HDR brackets in manual exposure mode and take as many images as I need. <a href=\"http://cjsmithphotography.com/2011/12/12/better-way-shoot-hdr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the article that explains my process, here</a>. For this type of shot, I put my camera in three shot bracket mode and let it rip. If you put the 5D Mark II in 2-second delay mode it will fire all three shots with one press of the shutter button. If I had a 5D Mark III it would do the same thing but would take up to 7 exposures automatically. I can't wait.\nFor shooting your HDR images handheld, you need to make sure that you have a fast enough shutter speed for your brightest (longest) exposure. Shooting at 17mm, I needed to get an exposure faster than 1/17th of a second.  It is much easier to handhold when you are using a wide angle lens. Using the reciprocal rule, you would need 1/200th of a second for a 200mm lens. In this case, I needed to bump to ISO 3200 to get an exposure of 1/20th on the brightest exposure. I put the camera in 2-second delay, held out my hands, composed the shot, took a deep breath, hit the shutter button, and tried to stay as still as possible. I did this five or six times so that when I got the images back to my computer I could pick the sharpest images.\nWhen you import the images into Photomatix, you will need to make sure that the images are aligned. I have heard that Photoshop does a better job than Photomatix lining the images up, but I have never had a problem letting Photomatix align the images.\n<strong>Big Announcement! Topaz Labs and the Out of Chicago Photo Walk #3</strong>\nI am proud to announce that Topaz Labs will be sponsoring the photo competition for our third photo walk this weekend.  The grand prize winner will win a bundle of Topaz software.  Two runners up will win their choice of one Topaz product. I hope to see you this Saturday!

It is because of this concealment that it had survived the thirty Years War and remained unscathed during both World Wars. Mespelbrunn is one of the few castles in Germany that has retained its original form with the oldest part of the castle being the mighty tower. Its origins date back to the thirteenth century.\n\nOther parts of the Mespelbrunn castle were erected by the knight Peter Echter and replaced a smaller building which stood between the tower and the chapel. The northern and eastern aisles of the castle are supported by fascinating stone columns. Those on the north side are decorated with rosettes, heads of angels and masks, very typical emblems of the Renaissance style. This part of the castle is entirely built in German Renaissance style. On one of the columns with a carved date of 1564 you will see the alliance coat of arms of the knight Peter Echter and his wife, Lady Adelsheim. It depicts the coat of arms of the Echter Family - three rings and the horn of the Adelsheim.\n\nMespelbrunn castle also contains a Knights' Hall where the knights formerly assembled. The porches, windows and columns in the hall are made of magnificent red sandstone, and the carved hands at the base of these columns symbolizes the strong relationship between its inhabitants to the soil. There is a tradition that, as long as these columns in the knights hall are standing, the Ingleheim-Echter family will flourish.\n\nThe Chapel, situated in the north-west corner of the castle, was built by the knight Hamann Echter, who also established a farm for a priest to live on. Until recently a priest lived at Mespelbrunn castle and celebrated Holy Mass every day. The Chapel altar was built in the 16th century by another member of the family, and was made of alabaster by the Wuerzburg master, Michael Kern.\n\nSome of the windows in the castle have been painted by Countess Antoinette Ingleheim. They show the genealogical tree of the last Lady Echter, her coat of arms, the coat of arms of her parents, grandparents, great grand parents and so on. Other windows show the genealogical tree of her husband: Count Philip Ludwig von Ingleheim.\n\nBy grant of the Kaiser, Count von Ingleheim combined his name and coat of arms with that of the Echter family - Count von Ingleheim and his descendants are now called Count Ingleheim Echter von Mespelbrunn.

It is the first masjid in this region to be constructed according to the principles of Mughal courtyard architecture. Atypical of masajid, this building is elongated along the east-west rather than the usual north-south axis. Red brick is utilized rather than the pink sandstone and marble more commonly associated with Mughal buildings. Quite likely, the decision to use brick was made out of practical concerns of cost and availability, since Thatta does not have much stone. The surfaces are decorated with glazed tiles. \n\nThe Shah Jahan mosque represents the height of tile decoration in the Sind. The influence of mosaic on tile work is seen in the ceiling decoration of semi-domed and domed chambers, as well as in the fillings of interlaced arches and in the panels at squinch level. The technique of soft glazed tile paneling had been in use since the Tarkhan period. Various shapes of tiles - square, rectangular and hexagonal - were manufactured and joined to complete a design in a given panel. The tilework is not related to the imperial Mughal style, but to the Timurid school. Various shades of blue on white, and some yellow or purple background produce a very soothing effect in the hot climate of Thatta\n\nThe masjid was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a gesture of gratitude to the people of Thatta for sheltering him during his youth after his father Emperor Jahangir banished him from Delhi.

Thanks Chris - I am happy you enjoyed it!  Keep up the good HDR work and fight the good fight for us! :)\n\nNikon D3S Review Continues\n\nI have a Nikon D3S still on loan... and I'm putting together some images for my <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/nikon-d3s-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nikon D3S Review</a>.  I don't have it finished yet.... these things take a while, but, so far, I am very impressed!\n\nIn fact, I'm so impressed, that I am going to <a href=\"http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/655574-REG/Nikon_25466_D3S_Digital_SLR_Camera.htmlBI/2463/KBID/3297\" rel=\"nofollow\">B&amp;H Photo</a> tonight to buy the full thing as a backup to my D3X!  (You can see more info there on my <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/nikon-d3x-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nikon D3X review</a>)\n\nThe Taj Mahal from Akbar's Palace\n\nThis image below was made with some textures from my <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/textures-tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Textures Tutorial</a>.  This is the only time that I &quot;color&quot; photos.  Many times, I think people might think that I &quot;paint&quot; on top of my photos, but I do not.  Sometimes, however, when I have an image that came out, ummm, a little more boring that it should be, I will give it a texture treatment.  Maybe you are like me, and, on occasion, you take what you think will be a great shot.  Then, you get home, and it just came out sort of boring.. that is always a bummer feeling.  To get around that, I often use textures that I have collected from around the world.\n\nAkbar's palace has about one-tenth the number of visitors of the Taj Mahal, and it is almost just as stunning for photography.  There are so many interesting and fun compositions, you just can't go wrong.  I recommend a full day here and a full day in and around the Taj Mahal.  Besides these two major locations, the city streets, alleys, and everything in between are also highly recommended! \n\nfrom the blog at <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a>", "tags": ["stucktextures", "tajmahal", "india", "textures", "agra", "stuckincustoms", "trey", "ratcliff", "stuck", "customs", "blog", "photography", "hdr", "high", "dynamic", "range", "digital", "imaging", "travelblog", "nikon", "d2xs", "color", "taj", "akbar\u2019s", "palace", "akbar", "mahal", "texture", "processed", "treatment", "\u0924\u093e\u091c", "\u092e\u0939\u0932", "arches", "walk", "sepia", "unesco", "world", "heritage", "site", "mughal", "architecture", "dome", "minaret", "history", "ajmer", "medieval", "jehangir", "rajputana", "\u0905\u091c\u092e\u0947\u0930", "travel", "rajasthan", "ajaymeru"], "owner": {"username": "Stuck in Customs", "id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff"}, "title": "The Taj from Akbar's Palace"}, "title": "The Taj from Akbar's Palace"}

This needs to be appreciated by the West before a sincere bridge of mutual friendship, is built.\n\n\nMuslims\u2019 call to rule over Jerusalem is not driven by colonist, nationalist or material motives. The love of every grain in the Holy City and Al-Aqsa is sacred to Muslims. As Muslims\u2019 respect all the Prophets revered by Judaism and Christianity and their venerated places are also central to the ethos of Islam.\n\nIt is only by entrusting the custody of the Holy City (and Al-Aqsa) to the Muslims can the present Judaisation of Jerusalem come to a halt and morally open the city to all the three faiths.\n\n\nTo quote a few Qur\u2019anic verses and sayings of Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him] with regard to Jerusalem will indicate the importance Masjid al Aqsa and therefore Jerusalem has assumed upon the Muslims hearts.\n\n\n1. The miraculous journey of the holy Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him] from Makkah to Masjid al Aqsa (al Isra) and his ascension through the heavens (al Ma\u2019araj) has linked Jerusalem to the Muslims hearts and minds. The Holy Qur\u2019an states:\n\nGlory to Allah who did take His Servant for a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) to the Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) whose precincts We did bless (al-Isra 17: 1)\n\n\n- The Lord Almighty had at in His power to have taken the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) from Makkah straight up to the heavens. However, to impress the importance of Jerusalem upon Muslims the Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him] was first taken to Masjid al Aqsa in Jerusalem.\n\n\n- When in Masjid al Aqsa Haram Shareef the Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him] led Salaah and was followed by all the previous Prophets peace be upon him. Hence the whole of Masjid al Aqsa precincts are unique in that this is the only place on earth where all the Prophets peace be upon him performed Salaah in congregation.\n\n\n- The Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) peace be upon him central to all the three faiths migrated to the land of Canaanite around 1805 BC. The Qur\u2019an states:\n\nWe said, O Fire! Be thou cool and safety for Ibrahim. Then they planned against him, but We made them the greater losers. But We delivered him and (his nephew) Lot (and directed them) to the land which We have blessed for the nations (Al-Anbiyaa 21: 69-71)\n\n\n2. The sacredness of Jerusalem is emphasised on numerous places in the Holy Qur\u2019an. The Apostles of Allah, Muhammad [peace be upon him] and also Prophet Musa (Mosses) [peace be upon him] alluded to it. The Holy Qur\u2019an reports Prophet Musa [peace be upon him] telling his people:\n\n\nO my people! Enter the holy land\u2026 \n(Al-Maida 5: 21)\n\n\n3.Further the Holy Qur\u2019an states:\n\n(It was Our power that made) the violent (unruly) Wind flow (tamely) for Sulaman. To his order, to the land Which We had blessed\u2026 \n(Al-Anbiyaa 21: 81)\n\n\n4. Masjid al Aqsa and therefore Jerusalem\u2019s importance was further emphasised by the sayings of Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him]:\n\n\n(a) According to Islamic teachings there are only three places to which it is desirable to undertake a journey for the purpose of Salaah.\n\nAbu Huraira [ra] is quoted as saying that Allah\u2019s Messenger [peace be upon him] said, \u2018set out deliberately on a journey only to three mosques: this mosque of mine (in Medina), the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) and the Masjid al Aqsa (in Jerusalem) (Bukhari &amp; Muslim)\n\n\n(b) The virtues of praying in Masjid al Aqsa are exalted:\n\n\nAbu Darda [ra] is quoted as saying that the Prophet of Allah Muhammad [peace be upon him] said, a prayer in the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) is worth 100, 000 prayers, a prayer in my mosque (in Medina) is worth 1, 000 and a prayer in Jerusalem is worth 500 prayers more than in an any other mosque. (Bukhari)\n\n\nAs part of another tradition, on the authority of Maimunah bint Sa\u2019d, it is reported that, upon being asked about a person who is unable to travel to the Masjid al Aqsa, the Messenger of Allah [peace be upon him] said, \u2018He should make a gift of oil to be burnt therein, for He who gives a gift to the Masjid al Aqsa will be like one who has prayed Salaah therein.\u2019 (Ahmad &amp; Ibn Majah)\n\n\n(c) The Masjid al Aqsa is the second house of prayer established on earth:\n\n\nAbu Dhar [ra] is quoted as saying, I asked the beloved Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon him] which was the first mosque on earth? \u2018The Sacred Mosque (in Makkah),\u2019 he said. And then which, I asked? \u2018Masjid al Aqsa,\u2019 he said. I further asked, what was the time span between the two? \u2018Forty years,\u2019 the Prophet [peace be upon him] replied. (Muslim)\n\n\n(d) Abu Umamah al Bahili [ra] reports that the Prophet of Allah [peace be upon him] as saying, \u2018A group of my ummah will remain firm upon the truth, dominating their enemies. They will not be harmed by their opponents until Allah\u2019s decree arrives upon them. They asked, \u2018Oh Prophet of Allah [peace be upon him]! Where will they be?\u2019 He replied, \u2018In Bait al Maqdis and its surrounding areas. (Ahmad)\n\n\n5. The Masjid al Aqsa was the First Qibla (the direction to which Muslims faced when praying Salaah):\n\n\nThe centrality, historical and cultural significance of Masjid al Aqsa is further emphasised by the fact that Muslims used to turn towards Jerusalem when they prayed. This was practised until 16 to 17 months after hijra, when Allah I commanded in His wisdom, for the Muslims to face Makkah. The importance of Masjid al Aqsa remained and all the worship performed facing Masjid al Aqsa was good and valid.\n\n\n6. The resting place of Prophets [peace be upon him] and Prophet\u2019s companions [ra]:\n\n\nThe land of Palestine has in it some of the noblest souls the earth has seen. The graves of many Prophet\u2019s are in Palestine. Including Ibrahim peace be upon him, Yakub peace be upon him, Ishaq [peace be upon them] and according to some commentators there are over 100 Prophets buried in Palestine.\n\n\nPalestine also has the bodies of some of the closest companions of the Prophet e and thus the first generation Muslims. Included in these are the graves of Ubada ibn al Samit, Shaddad ibn Aws ibn Thabit al Ansari and Tamim al Dari [ra].\n\n7. Freedom of the Holy City.\n\n\nAfter the battle of Yarmuk the Muslim forces under the command of Abu Ubaydahr alay siege to Jerusalem. The inhabitants consented to surrender on condition the Khalifa, Umar ibn al Khattabr acame in person. Umar [ra] travelled to Palestine and formally received the keys to the city in 637 AC. On his arrival, he concluded the famous peace treaty with the people of Holy City. This opened the doors to the Jews, who were denied access for thousands of years and for the first time Jerusalem under Muslim rule became truly an OPEN CITY to all the three faiths.

The memorial is one of the most impressive sites in Washington, DC. A 19-foot bronze statue of Jefferson is surrounded by passages from the Declaration of Independence and Jefferson\u2019s other writings. \n\nThomas Jefferson is one of the greatest figures in the history of the United States. The author of the Declaration of Independence was one of the founding fathers of the United States. A firm believer in equal rights, democracy, education available to all, freedom of religion and separation between church and state, he gave form to the nascent nation still searching for its identity. Besides being a politician, Jefferson was also an architect, a writer, musician, scientist and inventor.\n\nThe Jefferson Memorial is one of the most popular attractions in the nation's captital and is located on the Tidal Basin, surrounded by a grove of trees making it especially beautiful during Cherry Blossom season in the spring. From the top steps of the memorial, you can see one of the best views of the White House.

I have been on it for a while, but I haven't put in the time to make it really work for me.  So I am going to challenge myself to work with Google+ for one month.

Connect with at least 10 people each day on Google+ by adding them to my circles and commenting on their posts.\nThroughout this process, I will put many of the tips and tricks that I learn along the way in my daily posts. I hope that some of you will choose to join me on a one month experiment with Google+.  If you are already on Google+, put your name in the comments, and I will add you to an Out of Chicago circle that I will be sharing in the future.

I'm a huge fan of Impressionism, and this museum has an amazing collection.  It also houses one of the most famous paintings by Manet -  Le dejeuner sur l'herbe (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_d%c3%a9jeuner_sur_l'herbe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>).  I've always heard about and studied this painting, so it was of particular interest to me.  When I saw it in person, it was absolutely striking... I did not expect to have a reaction like that.\n\nWell, you aren't supposed to take photos in here, but I just can't help it.  I think the rule is silly and somewhat insulting to he artist in me.  I remember studying the Impressionists...  Manet himself would come into museums and paint...  so what is the difference?  Nothing... I think my Impressionist heroes are looking down on me and smiling for defying such a silly rule.  In this case, I did not use a tripod (would have been a bit obvious).  So I cranked up the ISO on my camera to keep everything sharp.  Also, I set my F stop at 2.8, which keeps a scene like this in focus when you're using a wide angle lens, since everything is effectively at infinity.\n\nfrom the blog <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a>", "tags": ["stuckincustoms", "treyratcliff", "stuck", "customs", "stuckincustomscom", "travel", "blog", "travelblog", "photography", "photoblog", "photographyblog", "hdr", "high", "dynamic", "range", "imaging", "digital", "processing", "software", "tutorial", "hdrtutorial", "trey", "ratcliff", "world", "europe", "western", "france", "republic", "french", "r\u00e9publiquefran\u00e7aise", "state", "capital", "paris", "seine", "northern", "r\u00e9gionparisienne", "city", "historic", "urban", "metropolitan", "\u00eeledefrance", "region", "island", "district", "museum", "muse", "dorsay", "orsay", "d\u2019orsay", "mus\u00e9edorsay", "station", "railway", "gare", "beauxarts", "beaux", "arts", "architecture", "design", "aesthetic", "impressionism", "fineart", "painting", "artists", "history", "historical", "painter", "building", "neoclassical"], "owner": {"username": "Stuck in Customs", "id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff"}, "title": "The Orsay"}, "title": "The Orsay"}

This temple was built by Soma, a Dandanayaka (commander) in 1268 under Hoysala king Narasimha III, when the Hoysala Empire was the major power in South India.\n\nIt stands on a raised platform in the center of a spacious enclosure. There are a number of star shaped folds on the outer walls of Somnathpur Temple. All around the temple is an open verandah having 64 cells. The wealth of sculptured images is simply unbelievable, since from the base to the projected eaves, every inch of available wall surface is covered with the most exquisitely sculptured images. At the temple, the outer walls are decorated with a series of star-shaped folds and the entire surface is covered with carved stone plaques. The walls above the plinth are also carved with exquisite figures of gods and goddesses, taken from the Hindu puranas, and meticulously arranged in vertical panels.\n\nThe Chennakesava temple at Somnathpura is a scaled down version of the magnificent, grandiose Hoysala temples at Belur and Halebid. \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennakesava_Temple,_Somanathapura\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> \n\n<b>Follow me @ <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112233299343248188738/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google+</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/vinoth27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/vcphotography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a></b>", "tags": ["somnathpur", "chennakesava", "temple", "architecture", "hoysala", "dynasty", "kings", "karnataka", "india", "pointofview", "photo", "photos", "photography", "5d", "canon", "canoneos5dmarkii", "empire"], "owner": {"username": "VinothChandar", "id": "44345361@N06", "realname": "Vinoth Chandar"}, "title": "The Chennakesava Temple of Somnathpura"}, "title": "The Chennakesava Temple of Somnathpura"}

He or she is the person who performs with and kills the bull. The role is also called toreador in English (and in Bizet's opera Carmen), but this term (older than torero) is actually never used in Spain or in Latin America. The term torero encompases bullfighters who fight the bull in the ring. (picadores and rejoneadores)\n\nUsually, toreros start fighting young bulls (novillos), and are called novilleros. They can start fighting mature bulls after a special match, called &quot;the Alternative&quot;.

It is the oldest remaining house from the original site of the Town of York and was built by Upper Canada Chief Justice Sir William Campbell and his wife Hannah in 1822. The home was designed for entertaining and comfort, and constructed at a time when the Campbells were socially and economically established and their children had grown to adulthood.\nThe house is one of the few remaining examples of Georgian architecture left in Toronto and is constructed in a style in vogue during the late Georgian era known as Palladian architecture.\n\nIn 1972 the last owners of the property, the Coutts-Hallmark Greeting Cards Company, wanted to demolish the house in order to extend their parking lot. Prior to demolition the house was offered to anyone who could remove it from the property. A professional association of trial lawyers known as the Advocates Society, launched a campaign to save the building. Eventually it was arranged that the building would be moved to its current location at the corner of University Avenue and Queen Street West, south of the Canada Life Building. With assistance from maintenance trucks of the Toronto Transit Commission, the 270 tonne home was moved 1617 metres northwest from Adelaide Street to its current location in 1972. The move was a major spectacle, and attracted a large crowd as several downtown streets had to be shut down. Fully restored, it was reopened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother on 1 April 1972.\nThe preservation of the house was an important turning point in architectural preservation in Toronto. During the 1950s and 1960s, 19th-century homes were demolished at a rapid rate; architect Eric Arthur even predicted that by the year 2000, there may be no 19th-century buildings left in the city.[1] The spectacle of the physical move to save Campbell House was a preservation achievement which sparked greater interest among Torontonians to save other local landmarks when they became threatened.\nToday, the home serves as both a historic house museum and a club for the members of the Advocates Society. The museum also includes an art gallery.", "tags": ["campbell", "house", "toronto", "on", "ontario", "canada", "downtown", "museum", "oldest", "historic", "onasill", "preservation", "architecture", "georgian", "style", "flower", "garden", "restored", "landmark"], "owner": {"username": "Onasill", "id": "7156765@N05", "realname": "Onasill ~ Bill  Badzo"}, "title": "Toronto Ontario Canada ~ Campbell House ~ One of the few Photos I have taken of \"my city\" for flickr recently."}, "title": "Toronto Ontario Canada ~ Campbell House ~ One of the few Photos I have taken of \"my city\" for flickr recently."}

One of the signs, actually says... &quot;NO PHOTOGRAPHY.&quot;\n\nNot wanting to overstep my bounds, I ventured around the compound to see if I could capture it from another perspective. The entire complex is gated and walled off.\n\nThankfully I found a vantage point that gave me just enough room to compose this shot. \n\nI ended up doing a long exposure to add some movement to the sky and then processed the image in black and white using Nik Silver Efex.\n\nFor those of you that use Nik Silver Efex, I ended up using the yellow filter to really bring out the detail in the brick building.\n\nAll the best and happy shooting! :)", "tags": ["architecture", "blackandwhite", "brewery", "historic", "lempbrewery", "longexposure", "missouri", "monochrome", "saintlouis", "stlouis"], "owner": {"username": "Moose Winans", "id": "91164391@N05", "realname": "Moose Winans"}, "title": "The Old Abandoned Lemp Brewery - St. Louis, Missouri"}, "title": "The Old Abandoned Lemp Brewery - St. Louis, Missouri"}
