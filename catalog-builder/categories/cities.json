The cost of building City Hall was $6,851,546.85, including the architect's fees, making it one of the costliest city halls in the country.\nNRHP Reference#:\n98001611", "tags": ["buffalo", "ny", "new", "york", "city", "hall", "art", "deco", "building", "structure", "painted", "murals", "mural", "stain", "glass", "exterior", "interior", "images", "council", "chambers", "room", "lobby", "nrhp", "landmark", "historic", "onasill", "erie", "county", "western", "attraction", "tours", "walking", "travel", "must", "see", "architecture", "style", "historical"], "title": "Buffalo NY ~ City Hall ~ Art Deco Architecture ~ NRHP ~ Historic Building"}, "id": "15398148846", "favs": 48, "title": "Buffalo NY ~ City Hall ~ Art Deco Architecture ~ NRHP ~ Historic Building", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "320", "width": "243", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "640", "width": "486", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "100", "width": "76", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "1024", "width": "777", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "2048", "width": "1554", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_014e0fb565_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "1600", "width": "1214", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_558ed80c6b_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "800", "width": "607", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "240", "width": "182", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "2048", "width": "1554", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_0fe6cdb7a2_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "500", "width": "379", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/onasill/15398148846/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15398148846_eb256128ab.jpg"}}}

Cheers.\n\nIf you catch the city at the right angle you can see its many avenues stretching through the urban jungle and into the horizon.  Little cars zipping up and down avenues are like active little microbes in a test tube.  \n\nI've been noticing a lot more photos that are completely photoshopped.  I recently joined 500px.  This new photo sharing site is supposed to be more of a stylized version of Flickr, with more of an emphasis on really outstanding photos.  However, I find that every other photo is completely photoshopped.  When I say photoshop, I mean either bits and pieces of other photos are pulled together to create a completely surreal scene, or it's in some way graphically enhanced.  I will say they certainly draw a lot of attention and are often visually pleasing, but I'm not sure how I feel about them.

{"info": {"owner": {"realname": "Justin Brown", "id": "40708728@N04", "username": "Justin in SD"}, "description": "There's something about big cities thats special to me. I'm not sure if it's because there's always something exciting happening, like a sporting event, a theater event or food and drink event. Or if it's because the buildings and architecture are so much larger and grander than what I'm used to on the west coast. Either way, there's something about cities like Chicago or New York that excites me, and even though it's not the same as being there, looking at photos from past trips always puts a smile on my face.\n\nThis is from the top of the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago. We had a busy day exploring the city so by the time we made it to the observation deck the sun was gone. The night time views are still spectacular, it just takes a little extra work to shoot through the glass without picking up reflections. In the end it's all worth it, the city really isn't alive until the lights are turned on. \n\nI almost forgot to mention, the best part about visiting the Willis (Sears) Tower, is you're directly across the street from my favorite pizza in the world.

Cheers.\n\n\nHurricane Irene was a let down to many New Yorkers (and it's probably a blessing).  The day before its arrival, looked like a scene from the end of the world.  People frantically catching cab cars, lines out the door at grocery stores and tape across storefront windows as the city shut down.  I managed to be invited to my friend's place who is a chef at one of the five star restaurants in the city.  Because of the storm, the restaurant had to give away all of its food.  So naturally, I at scallops and short ribs, while Irene raced towards us.  It turned out to be nothing more than a lot of rain and a little wind. Yesterdays wind brought about some interesting cloud formations, as the storm pulled through and finally dissipated towards the end of the day.  I was able to grab a shot of the sun coming through just before it set.\n\nMy photo was featured on CBS Nightly News - I'm at the end of the clip.  I had a blast being interviewed though and honored to have the shot on their show.

Beijing is so spread out -- there does not seem to be a central focus in the traditional &quot;skyscraper&quot; sense.  I've taken a few other downtown shots you might recall (click on the&quot;Beijing&quot; category), but this spot was kind of cool and unique because of this tower I was in.\n\nI happened to be outside with Joe McNally, after we finally convinced the officials to let us get beyond the inside and dirty windows.  We were out in the &quot;5th ring&quot; where many Olympic venues were built.  And so, here was this huge tower in the outskirts, looking back towards the city.  It seemed like a good situation for a zoom-in compression shot.\n\n- Trey Ratcliff\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2012/03/04/little-beijing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here to read the rest of this entry at the Stuck in Customs blog.</a>", "tags": ["beijing", "china", "httpwwwstuckincustomscomtreyratcliff", "stuckincustoms", "treyratcliff", "stuck", "customs", "stuckincustomscom", "travel", "blog", "travelblog", "photography", "photoblog", "photographyblog", "hdr", "high", "dynamic", "range", "imaging", "digital", "processing", "software", "tutorial", "hdrtutorial", "trey", "ratcliff", "east", "asia", "people\u2019srepublicofchina", "republic", "prc", "peking", "b\u011bij\u012bng", "\u5317\u4eac", "municipality", "city", "metropolis", "northern", "northernchina", "5thring", "\u4e94\u73af\u8def", "\u4e94\u74b0\u8def", "w\u01d4hu\u00e1nl\u00f9", "s001", "road", "expressway", "traffic", "cars", "lights", "blur", "urban", "cityscape", "night", "neon", "cyberpunk", "bladerunner", "skyscrapers", "architecture", "buildings", "september", "2011", "nikond3x"], "title": "Little Beijing"}, "id": "6798332864", "favs": 34, "title": "Little Beijing", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "238", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "475", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "74", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "760", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "3656", "width": "4924", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_72495fe3d7_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "1188", "width": "1600", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_d34bc80741_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "594", "width": "800", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "178", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "1521", "width": "2048", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_124ba7dfff_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "371", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/6798332864/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6798332864_4e46441334.jpg"}}}

I think these areas are always full of life and excellent for people-watching.  Often times, this is why I don't mind being by myself in these foreign places... it's very nice to sit back and just analyze people as they come and go.\n\nThis was shot in the middle of Dresden when there was just a few degrees of sunlight left behind the old church.  Once things get too black in the sky, I usually pack up the tripod and then head to the best looking gelato place I had surveyed earlier in the day.\n\nThanks again for all the feedback on the newsletter yesterday!  We should get all of this cleaned up and ready for the first release sometime within the next two weeks or so...  I hope your expectations aren't TOO high... although I'll do my best of course.

{"info": {"owner": {"realname": "Trey Ratcliff", "id": "95572727@N00", "username": "Stuck in Customs"}, "description": "Seoul is one of those cities that keeps going in every direction to the horizon.  Those mountains in the distance are really really far away, and it's non-stop activity between here and there.  I've always wanted to try taking the subway to the end, but never quite had the opportunity to do so.  But, while there, I did get to know the subway system pretty well.  \n\nI was amazed at how the girls on the subways would take non-stop photos of themselves with their mobile phones.  They would look at themselves, make a few adjustments, show their friends, then do it again and again.  You don't see that here in the states...  (yet!)\n\nI believe (the smart readers here will correct me if I'm wrong) that this is facing north.  Seoul is right on the border of North Korea, so it's just a short distance to the edge.  In fact, it's so short that they occasionally find tunnels that come up near the outskirts of Seoul as people are digging their way out.

It also has responsibilities and ownerships beyond the City's boundaries.

Throughout the 19th century, the City was the world's primary business centre, and continues to be a major meeting point for businesses.

Sometimes that curiosity leads me to actually try new things. \n\nI think it's been over a year that I've been admiring the visuals of long exposure photography. For Christmas I got a 10-stop ND filter, but it took me until this past week to finally get out and give it a try. \n\nLong exposures take a lot more setup than other forms of photography. It's important to make sure the composition is right, the focus is set, light leaks are covered, and the exposure time is calculated and correct. If I were going back in time, I probably would have spent the extra money for square or rectangular ND filters, as opposed to the screw on B+W filters I have. Filters that can be easily removed, especially without significant risk to bumping the zoom or focus ring on the lens would make the process much easier. For this image I used a 10-stop and a 6-stop ND filter to get a 5 minute 30 second exposure. It is a single exposure, and no HDR, which is pretty rare for me.", "tags": ["longexposure", "nd", "ndfilter", "seaportvillage", "hyatt", "hyattregency", "sandiego", "downtown", "city", "hotel", "architecture", "color", "light", "streak", "cloud", "clouds", "cloudstreak", "canon", "canon5d", "canon5dmarkiii", "5d3", "seaport", "marina", "tourist"], "title": "Seaport Village Streaks"}, "id": "14374863803", "favs": 49, "title": "Seaport Village Streaks", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "320", "width": "256", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "640", "width": "512", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "100", "width": "80", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "1024", "width": "819", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "3469", "width": "2775", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_8224767fa1_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "1600", "width": "1280", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_123ece64b0_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "800", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "240", "width": "192", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "2048", "width": "1638", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_c067ed0a5a_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "500", "width": "400", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/14374863803/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14374863803_fa11ae12bf.jpg"}}}

Unfortunately, we only had access in the late afternoon, but wow was it awesome.  We were up on a rooftop all by ourselves, nobody else around, \n\nI was traveling with my girlfriend, and she had a sorority sister who worked in Manhattan. We didn't know what building she worked in, or what kind of view she had, but we did what we could to contact her for a visit when we both had free time.  Turns out, her office was on the 41st floor looking out over the Hudson river (awesome), and she had access to the building rooftop, with this incredible 360 degree view of Manhattan.  Whenever we go back to Manhattan (which I hope is soon), I'm pretty sure I will do everything I can to get up here at dusk/night.  Although I do admit, it was still an incredible spot during the day.  The view of the Empire State Building is probably my favorite of any I've seen in Manhattan, the typical view from the top of the rock is boring, because you really only see one side of the building, and the fact that streets are visible is great.  One of the biggest complaints I had about the view from the top of the rock (stay tuned for images to come) was that the streets really are not visible.", "tags": ["newyork", "newyorkcity", "nyc", "newyorknewyork", "roof", "rooftop", "fisheye", "view", "empirestate", "empirestatebuilding", "city", "cityscape", "skyscraper", "tall", "day", "hdr", "canon", "canon5d", "canon5dmarkiii", "5d3", "5dmark3"], "title": "Reach for the Sky"}, "id": "8025834548", "favs": 49, "title": "Reach for the Sky", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "214", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "428", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "67", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "684", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "3800", "width": "5689", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_c0076a8a4b_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "1069", "width": "1600", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_9e07558aab_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "534", "width": "800", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "160", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "1368", "width": "2048", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_5bdeab6b63_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "334", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/justininsd/8025834548/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8025834548_a2eb6f2115.jpg"}}}

{"info": {"owner": {"realname": "Ted McGrath", "id": "90955804@N04", "username": "Ted's photos - For me & you"}, "description": "A view off the Lido deck of the MS Zaandam parked at a Canada Place birth in downtown Vancouver BC.\nThe neat old art deco building framed by the newer erections is the beautiful 1930 Marine Building.\n\nTHE MARINE BUILDING:\nFrom a 2010 Vancouver Sun Article.\n\nSeventy-five years ago, the cornerstone was laid for the grandest and most opulent skyscraper Vancouver had ever seen. Built at the onset of the Great Depression, the Marine Building would prove to be a financial bust, driving its original owners broke. But artistically, it was a complete success, arguably the best building ever built in Vancouver, and one of the finest examples of art deco architecture in the world.\n\n&quot;The building suggests some great marine rock rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea green, flashed with gold, at night a dim silhouette piercing the sea mists,&quot; wrote The Vancouver Sun in an opening day supplement on Oct. 7, 1930.\n\nGreat marine rock or not, the Marine Building looks impressive from any angle.\n\nLooking west from Granville and Hastings, the elegant symmetry of the building's central tower is simply breathtaking, its white terra cotta trim providing the perfect accent to its brown brick body.\n\nStanding in front of the swinging doors at 355 Burrard, it's hard to know what to highlight: the seahorses, crabs and assorted sea life carved into the bronze door frame, the eight historic ships etched in bas relief above the front arch, or the terra cotta zeppelins, biplanes and trains subtly placed amid the brick to signify state of the art transportation circa 1929.\n\nThe two-storey-high lobby is just as cool. The soft brown tiled walls give it a timeless air, as if you are entering some special, ancient place (supposedly, it was designed to evoke a Mayan temple). But there are also some classic deco futurist geometric designs, sunbursts, lightning bolts and zigzags.\n\nThrow in the mind-blowing elevators (bronze doors a dazzling array of sea fauna and an exploding star, interior an intricate blend of exotic woods) and the unbelievable plasterwork on the ceiling (featuring even more sea life) and you've got a building that is utterly unique, and uniquely Vancouver.\n\nPerched on the edge of the downtown bluff that was the original Coal Harbour shoreline, the Marine Building was designed to be the office building downtown, an architectural showpiece that would serve as the hub of the city's thriving marine trade. For a short time, it was the tallest building in the British Empire.\n\n&quot;It really was designed to be the best building in Canada,&quot; said heritage expert John Atkin. &quot;Which it pretty well comes close to being.\n\n&quot;There wasn't anything that was off the shelf. It was all [specially] made for the building. That makes it very different from today, where you just go to a catalogue.&quot;\n\nThe building was the brainchild of Lt.-Cmdr. J.W. Hobbs, an enthusiastic English transplant who had become the vice-president of G.A. Stimson and Co. Ltd. of Toronto, which proudly called itself &quot;Canada's oldest bond house.&quot;\n\nHobbs contracted the local architecture firm of McCarter and Nairne to bring his vision to reality. Fresh off designing the deco Medical-Dental Building at Georgia and Howe, John McCarter and George Nairne let their imaginations run wild on the Marine Building.\n\nEverything was designed in the deco style, and most everything has a marine theme. The second-storey wall sconces in the lobby are shaped like ships' prows. The lobby clock has sea creatures instead of numbers (a starfish for 12, a lobster for six, etc.). Lobby tiles feature a smiling whale and a Viking ship.\n\nStreamlined Canada geese soar above the front entrance, illuminated by rays of sunshine that were originally cloaked in gold leaf. An osprey looms above the swinging door with a fish in its claws, and an eagle stands guard at the top of the entrance. The signs of the zodiac are etched into the lobby floor.\n\nThe terra cotta trim on the upper wings is supposed to represent sea foam on the great marine rock. Terra cotta busts of King Neptune stand watch from the four corners of the 16th floor, and if you look closely, you can spot his trident and crown, as well.\n\n&quot;This is the height of art deco, the absolute height of it,&quot; says Don Luxton, president of the Canadian Art Deco Society.\n\n&quot;In the late '20s, we'd absorbed all the stuff they were doing in Europe and kind of synthesized into a North American environment, and went crazy with it in terms of the amount of ornamentation.&quot;\n\nConstruction began March 13, 1929, and the building officially opened Oct. 8, 1930. Impresario Hugh Pickett was among the hundreds of Vancouverites who attended the gala opening. Mayor William Malkin opened the doors with a golden key and Lt.-Gov. R. Randolph Bruce opened the Vancouver Merchants Exchange in the northern wing of the main floor.\n\n&quot;It was quite a gala event, because it was the biggest building in the city,&quot; Pickett recalls.\n\n&quot;There was a big mob of citizens, ladies, gentlemen. Everybody that was interested in the city was there ... it was an important moment in the history of the city.&quot;\n\nAlas, the elaborate decoration was expensive, and came in way over budget. The Marine Building was projected to cost $1.5 million, but wound up costing $2.3 million, which proved disastrous for Hobbs and the Stinson company.\n\nHobbs somehow managed to get the money together to complete the skyscraper after the stock market collapse set off a worldwide economic depression Oct. 17, 1929, but by 1931, mortgage holder James Richardson of Winnipeg was suing (and winning) for non-payment of $250,000.\n\nDesperate to raise cash, Hobbs offered the building to the City of Vancouver for $1 million. Vancouver was considering building a new city hall at the time, but turned him down. British Pacific Building Co. wound up purchasing the Marine Building for $900,000 in July, 1933.\n\nThe driving force behind British Pacific was Victoria-born international financier A.J.T. (Fred) Taylor, who later convinced Britain's Guinness beer family to invest in the company. With Guinness money, British Pacific built the Lion's Gate Bridge and developed British Properties in West Vancouver.\n\nTaylor ran British Pacific from offices on the 19th floor. Above his office was a two-storey, three-level penthouse with a wraparound terrace, which was supposed to be the Marine Building's observation tower.\n\nNobody could afford the 25-cent admission price in the Depression, so it was empty until Taylor had it converted into his personal mansion.\n\nThe Marine Building penthouse is the stuff of legend, a masterpiece outfitted in the latest 1930s decor. It had a 17-foot-high ceiling in the living room, a spiral staircase leading to two bedrooms on the mezzanine level, a marble fireplace, wood-panelled walls, teak floors and elaborately tiled bathrooms.\n\nThere are all sorts of stories attached to the penthouse. One is that Taylor never actually lived in it because his wife didn't like living so high in the sky. The Taylors did in fact live in a house in West Vancouver, but Luxton says the real reason Mrs. Taylor didn't want to live there was because as an office building the Marine Building shut down at night, leaving the Taylors marooned 300 feet above the city.\n\n&quot;They shut the elevators down at night,&quot; he says. &quot;They couldn't get down unless they walked down.&quot;\n\nAnother story is that Taylor once took a pony up to the penthouse terrace to entertain his kids. Atkin says this is true, but it's been spun into another yarn that is a little more far-fetched.\n\n&quot;There is a tourism publication that says businessmen in downtown Vancouver used to meet up there for horse races, and that they had a horse-racing track on the roof,&quot; says Atkin. &quot;Which is probably one of the dumbest things I've ever read.&quot;\n\nTaylor moved to New York at the start of the Second World War, and in 1941 the penthouse was rented to a Mrs. Mary Fisher. Not much is known about her, but local theatre legend Norman Young recalls that her son had some wicked &quot;Shaughnessy bathtub parties&quot; at the penthouse in the early 1940s.\n\n&quot;They were social parties in the '40s,&quot; explains Young with a laugh. &quot;Everybody would get drunk at the party and you'd cram into the bathtub as many people as you could, and then move on to the next bathroom. It was a way of mixing singles.\n\n&quot;But it could only take place in the mansions in Shaughnessy [because they had several bathrooms]. I think [the penthouse] had three bathrooms, but they weren't enough for a good party.&quot;\n\nThe Fishers moved out in 1944 and the penthouse was converted to an office by the Spencer department store family in 1947. It's now occupied by Sun Gold Mining company.\n\nThe Marine Building retained its prominence on the downtown waterfront for decades, but was finally eclipsed as the tallest building in the city in 1967 by the Guinness Tower next door, which is seven feet taller (328 feet to 321).\n\nThe Guinness family sold the Marine Building, the Guinness Tower and Oceanic Plaza to Campeau Corp. and Confederation Life for $81.8 million in 1985. Princeton Developments bought out Campeau's half in 1990 for $100 million, then sold one-third of the buildings to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) for $60 million.\n\nOMERS eventually bought out its partners and now operates the building by itself as Marine Building Holdings Ltd. The building's 2004 property assessment is $22,086,000.\n\nAn extensive, $17-million renovation was carried out from 1982-89 to update the electrical, mechanical and air-conditioning systems. Heritage activists were not pleased with some of the renovations, such as replacing with marble the lobby's original multi-coloured &quot;battleship linoleum,&quot; which had been imported from Scotland.\n\nThe former Merchant Exchange was also gutted and changed into the Imperial restaurant, a high-end Chinese restaurant favoured by an elite clientele (the Rolling Stones like to eat there when they're in town). But the Merchant Exchange's signature mural of the world was destroyed in the conversion, and its beautiful floor covered up when it was raised so diners could take advantage of the room's huge windows.\n\nThe biggest change, though, has been on the public views of the landmark building. As downtown has filled up with highrise towers, the Marine Building has lost its prominence on the waterfront.\n\nFor decades, it was the Coal Harbour skyline, a beacon to people arriving by water. Now it is hemmed in by Shaw Tower to the northwest, the Guinness Tower to the west, a federal office building to the south, the CIBC tower to the southeast, and the Daon building to the east. A planned hotel/residential tower by Marathon directly to the north will take away its last connection to the waterfront.\n\n&quot;It's a real pity,&quot; says Atkin. &quot;If it gets swallowed up in amongst the city, it loses something that's made it special over the years, being able to view it from the water.&quot;\n\nLuxton agrees, and thinks the city should have paid more attention to the prominence of the Marine Building when it was planning the Coal Harbour development. After all, it isn't likely that we'll ever see a building like it built again.\n\n&quot;The attention to detail, the workmanship, is absolutely astonishing,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;Can you imagine somebody doing something like that today, even thinking of making their building a public gesture like that? 'This is for the public. Come see our building, look how gorgeous this is.' &quot;\n\njmackie@vancouversun.com", "tags": ["alaskacruise", "bc", "britishcolombia", "tedsphotos", "vancouver", "vancouverbc", "vignetting", "marinebuilding", "marinebuildingvancouver", "vancouvermarinebuilding", "vancouverconventionscentre", "vancouverconventioncentrewest", "nikon", "nikonfx", "d600", "d600fx", "cropped", "vancouvercity", "towers", "cbd", "fairmont", "fairmonthotel", "fairmonthotelvancouver", "fairmontpacificrim", "shaw", "shawtower", "shawtowervancouver", "railing", "railings", "windows", "doors", "windowdoors", "streetscene", "cityview", "reflection", "reflecting", "buses", "cans2s", "5photosaday", "skyline", "2014", "street", "tower", "highrise", "centralbusinessdistrict"], "title": "2014 - Vancouver - Alaska Cruise -  CBD"}, "id": "15101221609", "favs": 34, "title": "2014 - Vancouver - Alaska Cruise -  CBD", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "182", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "363", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "57", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "581", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "5807", "width": "10240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_db9447a1f9_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "907", "width": "1600", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_8ca9ec91f2_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "454", "width": "800", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "136", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "1161", "width": "2048", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_ffdcda1f63_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "284", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/time-to-look/15101221609/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15101221609_b32a993d57.jpg"}}}

San Fran is a great town for that.  There are things to photograph on nearly every corner.  I made my way over to the gate at the entrance to Chinatown, and nearby was the Grand Hyatt.  I had read that there was a restaurant or bar sort of thing at the top, and that the view is great.  So, with camera and tripod in hand, I just walked into the hotel, made a beeline for the elevators, and hit the button for the top floor.  When I got out of the elevators, I found myself in a very busy place.  All the best tables were taken and it was crowded - but I guess I should have expected that.  It's not like they wait for me to arrive and just clear out.  Luckily I saw a little alcove off to the side - it looked like an area where they used to have pay phones, which I guess people don't really need anymore.  It was small, but most importantly it was empty and offered this wonderful view.

I post-processed a single RAW image into smooth HDR, then added some more vignetting to smoothen out the edges.\n\n-- Copyright 2014, Peter Thoeny, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, HDR, 1 RAW exposure, NEX-6,_DSC9277_hdr1smo2a", "tags": ["thecentrium", "hongkong", "orange", "gotham", "gothamcity", "hdr", "1xp", "raw", "nex6", "selp1650", "fav100", "night"], "title": "Hong Kong Gotham"}, "id": "13930790304", "favs": 50, "title": "Hong Kong Gotham", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "213", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "426", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "67", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "681", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "3276", "width": "4928", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_406377c4bd_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "1064", "width": "1600", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_1685d647ac_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "532", "width": "800", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "160", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "1361", "width": "2048", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_077c624955_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "333", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterthoeny/13930790304/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13930790304_efb50826f6.jpg"}}}

{"info": {"owner": {"realname": "Justin Brown", "id": "40708728@N04", "username": "Justin in SD"}, "description": "*Full Moon over the Marina*\n_San Diego, CA_\n\nI went out and shot the full moon from Shelter Island on Wednesday, and I ended up way off on my guess of where the moon would actually rise. I was hoping to get the moon rising over the hills directly behind the downtown cityscape. Instead I got the moon rising over the hangars at NAS North Island.\n\nI still really wanted to get a cityscape moonrise shot, so I decided to do a little research. I did a few google searches, and ultimately decided to buy the iOS app The Photographer's Ephemeris. The app lets you drop a pin on a map, and then it shows you the time and direction of the moonrise, moonset, sunrise and sunset for any day you choose. It also gives a bunch more information about the moon and sun, but in this case, all I was concerned with was the time and direction of the moonrise. The app was a bit on the pricey side, but it gave me exactly the information I was looking for.\n\nHaving shot from the end of Harbor Island closest to the city several times in the past year, I knew it offered great views of the city, and equipped with my new app I knew the moon would be rising right over The Grande condos, two of the tallest buildings in the middle of the skyline.\n\nThe trouble started when I arrived at the parking lot for Island Prime and found the whole end of the parking lot fenced off for construction. The area has been in a bit of construction limbo ever since they removed the paddle boat that was docked there a year or two ago. Previously however, there was still easy access to a walkway that lead down to the water, and had great views of the city, unfortunately that was no longer the case. The fence would not be too difficult to get around, but I'm not a big fan of passing no trespassing signs. Ultimately I decided to head back up Harbor Island and look for a parking spot on the side of Harbor Island Dr.\n\nAt this point, the moonrise was only a few minutes away, and as I drove I couldn't find a place to park. By the time I found a parking spot I was on the west half of the island, and had shifted my perspective enough that according to my app, the moon would be rising well to the right of the cityscape I had hoped to capture. With only a few minutes left, I decided to setup in this spot and I was able to get some shots from here. It's still not the image I've been hoping for, but it's a step closer compared to the one I got Wednesday night.\n\nWhen it comes to shooting the moonrise over San Diego, I actually prefer the night after the full moon. The moon is still big, and it comes up about an hour after sunset instead of just a few minutes later. That gives the city lights a little extra time to turn on and appear brighter against the darker night sky.

Yes, I think that sounds kinda sad.\n\nBut it's true!  What a great place for photography.  The lights are insane, the textures are off-the-wall, and everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes.  It's also a real challenge to try to get everything just right in the photo.  With so many light levels working against one another on your sensor, it takes a bit to get it right.\n\nI just finished recording another podcast today with Jim Goldstein from EXIF and Beyond.  Whenever that one comes online, I'll share it with y'all.  We talked a lot about HDR and how it can best be used.  I usually dial it up or down based on the photo, and this one, like my others, follows the steps in my HDR Tutorial.  I can't think of a better situation for HDR than Vegas at night.  I look forward to getting more time in Vegas to go take photos of the other casinos hotels.

{"info": {"owner": {"realname": "Alan Turkus", "id": "76345376@N00", "username": "aturkus"}, "description": "The dream was different today.  The helix spun me back into the dream, but when I reached the spot in Weehawken where Hamilton was shot, there was no sign of the Lenapes or of Hamilton or of Burr, except for the stain of Hamilton's blood in the grass.  I reached down and touched it with my finger.  It was wet still, and painted my finger red.  I was alone, though I thought I heard laughter faintly in the distance.  Today I dreamed my life was turned upside down.  Nothing seemed as it had the day before, all of my confidence had deserted me.  The city looked so peaceful as the sun started to cast long shadows.  I knew it was cold in the caverns of the city.  But the peace of the city stood in stark contrast to the turbulence within me.  I felt a sense of dread, but could not understand why.  Yes, I do hear laughter, I thought.  But where was it coming from?  Behind me?  Below me?  Both?  I couldn't be sure.  The madness of the city was within me today.  I had taken it through the tunnel and left the city in peace.  The sunset was breathtakingly beautiful tonight.  I couldn't reconcile the peace around me and the madness within me.  It began to get colder.  I heard more laughter, carried on the wind  that now swept all around me. I became very cold and felt scared.  I climbed back in my car and slowly eased my way onto the turnpike.  I couldn't tell if I was awake or asleep anymore and felt worried.  I called my friend Warren in Berkeley.  We had been playing phone tag for over a week.  He answered and I immediately felt better.  He told me that he had resigned from his job and would be leaving California for New Zealand with his wife and two daughters.  I could not have been happier for him.  He sounded at peace and excited for what was to come.  After he hung up, my sense of unease returned.  Was this still part of a dream?  Or was I awake again?  I thought about calling Warren back to see if we had really spoken.  I thought better of it, and drove on home.  I was happy for my friend, but worried for myself.  I wanted to wake up. \n\nBigger:  <a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=454776951&amp;size=Large\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Manhattan Sunset Dream #3' On Black</a>", "tags": ["manhattan", "newyorkcity", "nyc", "newyork", "ny", "sunset", "river", "hudson", "weehawken", "nj", "newjersey", "jersey", "hudsonriver", "empirestatebuilding", "skyline", "city", "commute", "commuting", "eveningcommute", "onthewayhome", "superbmasterpiece", "flickrdiamond", "diamondclassphotographer", "5photosaday"], "title": "Manhattan Sunset Dream #3"}, "id": "454776951", "favs": 49, "title": "Manhattan Sunset Dream #3", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_s.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "160", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_m.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "213", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_n.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_q.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "427", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "67", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "683", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "2912", "width": "4368", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_4ebe0d0d22_o.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "333", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aturkus/454776951/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/454776951_721ff7c8c0.jpg"}}}

It is the largest city in the province of Quebec, the second-largest city in Canada and the fifteenth largest in North America. Originally called Ville-Marie, or &quot;City of Mary&quot;,[6] the city takes its present name from Mount Royal,[7] the triple-peaked hill located in the heart of the city, whose name was also initially given to the island on which the city is located,[8][9] or Mont R\u00e9al as it was spelled in Middle French[10] (Mont Royal in present French).\n\nAs of May 10, 2011, Statistics Canada identifies Montreal's Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) (land area 4,259 square kilometres (1,644 sq mi)) as Canada's second most populous with an estimated metropolitan area population of 3,824,221[11] and a population of 1,886,481 in the &quot;agglomeration&quot; of Montreal, which includes all of the municipalities on the island of Montreal. The city of Montreal proper had a population of 1,649,519.[11]\n\nFrench is the city's official language[12][13] and is also the language spoken at home by 60.5% of the population in the city of Montr\u00e9al proper, followed by English at 21.2% and 23.4% other languages (as of 2006 census).[14] In the larger Montreal Census Metropolitan Area, 70.5% of the population speaks French at home, compared to 18.5% who speak English.[15] 56% of the population is able to speak both English and French.[16] Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world, after Kinshasa and Paris.[17][18]\n\nMontreal is consistently rated as one of the world's most livable cities, was called &quot;Canada's Cultural Capital&quot; by Monocle Magazine and recently was named a UNESCO City of Design.[19][20] Though historically the commercial capital of Canada, it was surpassed in population, as well as economic strength, by Toronto after 1976. Today it continues as an important centre of commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, culture, tourism, film and world affairs.[21]\n\nIn 2010, Montreal was named a hub city, ranked 34th globally out of 289 cities for innovation across multiple sectors of the urban economy, in the Innovation Cities Index by[clarification needed] 2thinknow.[22] Montreal was the next Canadian city in the annual index behind nexus city Toronto in 12th place and ahead of fellow hub cities Calgary, Quebec City, Vancouver and Edmonton.[23] In 2009, Montreal was named North America's number one host city for international association events, according to the 2009 preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).\n\nOld Montreal (French: Vieux-Montr\u00e9al) is a historic area located southeast of downtown containing many different attractions such as the Old Port of Montreal, Place Jacques-Cartier, Montreal City Hall, the Bonsecours Market, Place d'Armes, Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re Museum, the Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al Basilica, and the Montreal Science Centre.\n\nArchitecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored and are frequented by horse-drawn cal\u00e8ches carrying tourists. Old Montreal is accessible from the downtown core via the underground city and is served by several STM bus routes and metro stations, ferries to the South Shore and a network of bicycle paths.\n\nThe riverside area adjacent to Old Montreal is known as the Old Port. The Old Port was the former site of the worldwide Port of Montreal, but its shipping operations have been moved further east to its current larger site, leaving the former location as a recreational and historical area maintained by Parks Canada. The new Port of Montreal is now Canada's largest container port and the largest inland port on Earth.\n\nThe most popular sport in Montreal is ice hockey. The city's professional hockey team, the Montreal Canadiens, are one of the Original Six teams of the National Hockey League (NHL), and boast an NHL-record 24 Stanley Cup championships. The Canadiens' most recent Stanley Cup victory came in 1993. They have major rivalries with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins both of which are also Original Six hockey teams.\n\nThe Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) play at Molson Stadium on the campus of McGill University for their regular-season games. Late season and playoff games are played at the much larger, enclosed Olympic Stadium, which also played host to the 2008 Grey Cup. The Alouettes won the Grey Cup a total of 7 times, most recently in 2010. The McGill Redmen, Concordia Stingers, and Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al Carabins play in the CIS university football league.\n\nMontreal also has a storied baseball history. The city was the home of the minor-league Montreal Royals of the International League until 1960. In 1946, Jackie Robinson broke the baseball colour barrier with the Royals in an emotionally difficult year; Robinson was forever grateful for the local fans' fervent support.[130] Major League Baseball came to town in the form of the Montreal Expos in 1969. They played their games at Jarry Park until moving into Olympic Stadium in 1977. After 37 years in Montreal, the team relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2005 and re-branded themselves as the Washington Nationals.[131]\nOlympic Stadium, home of the former Montreal Expos and the largest stadium in Canada.\n\nThe Montreal Impact are the city's Major League Soccer team. They play at a soccer-specific stadium called Saputo Stadium. The Montreal Impact recently joined North America's biggest soccer league, the MLS in 2012. The Montreal games of the FIFA 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup were held at Olympic Stadium.[132]\n\nMontreal is the site of a high-profile auto racing event each year: the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One (F1) racing. This race takes place on the famous Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on \u00cele Notre-Dame. In 2009, the race was dropped from the Formula One calendar, to the chagrin of some fans,[133] but the Canadian Grand Prix returned to the Formula 1 calendar in 2010. The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve also hosted a round of the Champ Car World Series from 2002\u20132007, and currently is home to the NAPA Auto Parts 200, a NASCAR Nationwide Series race, and the Montr\u00e9al 200, a Grand Am Rolex Sports Car Series race.\n\nUniprix Stadium, built in 1993 on the former site of Jarry Park, is used for the Rogers Cup men's and women's tennis tournaments. The men's tournament is a Masters 1000 event on the ATP Tour, and the women's tournament is a Premier tournament on the WTA Tour. The men's and women's tournaments alternate between Montreal and Toronto every year.[134]\n\nMontreal was the host of the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium alone cost $1.5 billion;[135] with interest that figure ballooned to nearly $3 billion, and was only paid off in December 2006.[136] Montreal also hosted the first ever World Outgames in the summer of 2006, attracting over 16,000 participants engaged in 35 sporting activities.\n\n<a href=\"http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,86481579&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,86481579&amp;am...</a>", "tags": ["montreal", "canada", "hdr", "pano", "panorama", "panoramic", "nightlife", "club", "jazminmillion", "province", "quebec", "northamerica", "villemarie", "cityofmary", "canadasculturalcapital", "commerce", "aerospace", "finance", "pharmaceuticals", "technology", "design", "culture", "tourism", "film", "worldaffair", "olympicstadium", "habitat67", "ahuntsic", "cartierville", "anjou", "c\u00f4tedesneiges", "notredamedegr\u00e2ce", "lachine", "lasalle", "leplateaumontroyal", "lesudouest", "l\u00eelebizard", "saintegenevi\u00e8ve", "mercier", "hochelaga", "maisonneuve", "montr\u00e9alnord", "outremont", "pierrefonds", "roxboro", "rivi\u00e8redesprairies", "pointeauxtrembles", "rosemont", "lapetitepatrie", "saintlaurent", "saintleonard", "verdun", "villeray", "saintmichel", "parcextension", "latinquarter", "cit\u00e9multim\u00e9dia", "concordiauniversity", "mountroyalpark", "sainthelensisland", "\u00eelenotredame"], "title": "Canada's Cultural Capital            (ID:11291)"}, "id": "7219659586", "favs": 31, "title": "Canada's Cultural Capital            (ID:11291)", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_s.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "144", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_n.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "288", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "45", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "461", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "4493", "width": "9970", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_3df661e7a6_o.jpg"}, "Large 1600": {"height": "721", "width": "1600", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/h/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_5d8a644a3d_h.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_q.jpg"}, "Medium 800": {"height": "360", "width": "800", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/c/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_c.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "108", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c_m.jpg"}, "Large 2048": {"height": "923", "width": "2048", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/k/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_8fd2c88b07_k.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "225", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminmillion/7219659586/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/7219659586_0640fac91c.jpg"}}}

You may know interpreted by Frank Sinatra or Fred Astaire (lyrics at the end of the text). \n\nHamburg St. Pauli, Dancing Towers (Tanzende T\u00fcrme). The high-rises mark the beginning of the well-known Reeperbahn - the entertainment district of Hamburg. Before there has been a bowling-center - empty for many years but hosting in some rooms the music club Mojo Club.\n\nThe dancing towers were built after the plans of the architect Hadi Teheranis (BRT). He says the towers can be seen as a couple dancing tango, touching each other at the hips, while legs and upper body are moving away from each other. He claims that his plans carry sex and music.

By now, you have probably figured out that I just can't get enough of these downtown shots.  Each angle is nice and different in its own way.  Sometimes I like to freeze the action, and sometimes I like to let it flow.  It totally depends on my mood when I am shooting.\n\nWhile I am there, I usually have a pretty good idea of how I want to execute the post-processing.  It changes the way I take the shots.  For example, if I want the action frozen, I'll crank up the ISO so that the people don't drag across the shutter too much.  I have my 5 exposures so that the +2 (the longest) fires first.  So I know if the middle exposure (the anchor, I call it) has a shutter that is open too long.  I can just hear it.  If it feels too long, I double the ISO and it halves the shutter speed of the anchor.  This is always my action/reaction when shooting in aperture priority.\n\nRead more, including some exciting news about us and Flipboard, <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2010/12/27/thinking-of-tokyo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> at stuckincustoms.com.", "tags": ["japan", "tokyo", "stuckincustoms", "treyratcliff", "hdr", "high", "dynamic", "range", "photography", "photograph", "stuck", "customs", "stuckincustomscom", "trey", "ratcliff", "blog", "travel", "travelblog", "photographyblog", "hdrtutorial", "world", "downtown", "metropolitan", "metropolis", "city", "urban", "asia", "building", "skyscraper", "cityscape", "\u6771\u4eac", "t\u014dky\u014d", "\u6771\u4eac\u90fd", "t\u014dky\u014dto", "\u7279\u5225\u533a", "tokubetsuku", "nij\u016bsanku", "prefecture", "buildings", "architecture", "glass", "neon", "signs", "intersection", "pedestrian", "people", "walk", "walkway", "crossing", "cars", "traffic", "bustle", "nightlife", "night", "april", "2010", "nikond3x"], "title": "The Intersection"}, "id": "5301934889", "favs": 50, "title": "The Intersection", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_s.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "174", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_m.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "232", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_n.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_q.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "463", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "72", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "741", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "3887", "width": "5370", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_556f5084d4_o.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "362", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/5301934889/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5124/5301934889_30c9640e11.jpg"}}}

Die eigentliche Hauptwache ist das hier befindliche barocke Wachengeb\u00e4ude, die Bezeichnung ging aber um 1900 auf den ganzen Platz \u00fcber und verdr\u00e4ngte dessen fr\u00fcheren Namen Schillerplatz. Vor 1864 hie\u00df der Platz entsprechend seiner damaligen milit\u00e4rischen Funktion Paradeplatz.\n\nDer Platz wurde mehrmals umgestaltet. Seine heutige Gestalt ist durch eine gro\u00dfe \u00d6ffnung im Boden gepr\u00e4gt, die von manchen Frankfurtern auch kurz das Loch genannt wird. Durch die \u00d6ffnung erschlie\u00dft sich die B-Ebene, ein unterirdische Einkaufspassage unterhalb des Platzes, die au\u00dferdem als Zugang zu den unterirdischen Schnellbahnh\u00f6fen dient. Von der Passage aus besteht direkter Zugang in einige umliegende Gesch\u00e4fte, unter anderem zur Lebensmittel- und Feinkostabteilung des Warenhauses Kaufhof an der Hauptwache.\n\nAm Platz herrschen unterschiedliche Baustile. Zum einen befindet sich in der Mitte die barocke Hauptwache, die umgebenden Geb\u00e4ude sind dagegen aufgrund der Kriegsfolgen alle neuerer Architektur. Dominant sticht das Design des oberirdischen Teils der sogenannten Allianz-Passage hervor, die sich am westlichen Abschluss des Platzes befindet. F\u00fcr das Geb\u00e4ude werden zur Zeit Entw\u00fcrfe f\u00fcr einen Umbau entwickelt.\n\nIm Rahmen einer gro\u00dfangelegten Platzversch\u00f6nerung, angeregt durch den B\u00fcrgerverein Sch\u00f6neres Frankfurt, soll das Loch zur B-Ebene geschlossen werden. Die Finanzierung des Projekts ist allerdings noch nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Der dadurch entstehende Platz soll seinen Vorkriegsnamen \u201eSchillerplatz\u201c zur\u00fcckerhalten und das in die Taunusanlage verbannte Standbild des Dichters Schiller soll entsprechend dem Goethedenkmal wieder in die Mitte des Platzes zur\u00fcckkehren.\n\nMit Ausnahme des Stra\u00dfenzugs Ro\u00dfmarkt \u2013 Gro\u00dfe Eschenheimer Stra\u00dfe ist der Platz eine Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone.\n\nDas f\u00fcr den ganzen Platz namengebende barocke Geb\u00e4ude wurde 1729-30 vom Stadtbaumeister Johann Jakob Samhaimer erbaut. Es entstand ein rechteckiger, eingeschossiger Bau mit einem Mansardgeschoss und einem gro\u00dfen Walmdach. Die S\u00fcdseite bildet mit einer repr\u00e4sentativen Giebelfront die Schaufassade des Geb\u00e4udes.\n\nDie Hauptwache war der Sitz der Stadtwehr und beinhaltete auch ein Gef\u00e4ngnis. Die Stadtwehr, auch B\u00fcrgerwehr, war die regul\u00e4re Armee der Freien Stadt Frankfurt, eines bis 1866 bestehenden souver\u00e4nen Stadtstaats. 1833 wurde beim Frankfurter Wachensturm auch die Hauptwache gest\u00fcrmt. Als Preu\u00dfen 1866 die Stadt annektierte, verlor Frankfurt mit seiner Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t auch seine milit\u00e4rische Bedeutung und damit die Stadtwehr.\n\nDas Gef\u00e4ngnis blieb und die Hauptwache wurde zur Polizeiwache umfunktioniert. Doch dieser Zustand dauerte nicht lange an. 1904 wurde aus dem Geb\u00e4ude ein Caf\u00e9, das es bis heute ist. Das Caf\u00e9haus und vor allem die benachbarte Normaluhr wurden zum bekanntesten Treffpunkt f\u00fcr Verabredungen in der Innenstadt. 1944 brannte die Hauptwache nach den schweren Bombenangriffen v\u00f6llig aus, bis sie 1954 in saniertem Zustand wiederer\u00f6ffnet wurde. Dieses Provisorium mit ver\u00e4ndertem Dach blieb bis zum Bau der U-Bahn. 1967 wurde es zun\u00e4chst komplett abgebaut, um es dann ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter - an geringf\u00fcgig ver\u00e4nderter Position - \u00fcber dem U-Bahnhof wieder aufbauen zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptwache\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia", "tags": ["hauptwache", "schillerplatz", "baroque", "plaza", "platz", "place", "station", "wolfgang", "staudt", "frankfurt", "skyscrapers", "lindner", "frankfurtammain", "hessen", "germany", "rivermain", "skyline", "leinpfad", "blauestunde", "clouds", "cloudy", "\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03ba\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7", "europe", "hotelroom", "windows", "sunset", "city", "bigcity", "skyscraper", "sky", "lindnerhotels", "lindnercityplaza", "evening", "wolfgangstaudt", "sigma", "tripod", "nikon", "\u6cd5\u862d\u514b\u798f", "nikond300", "66111", "\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0641\u0648\u0631\u062a", "touristphotographie", "\u6cd5\u5170\u514b\u798f", "holidays", "armchairs", "\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0444\u0443\u0440\u0442", "zimmer", "hotelzimmer", "aussicht", "wolkenkratzer", "\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0641\u0648\u0631\u062a", "sonnenuntergang", "sessel", "couch", "stativ", "hdr", "\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0444\u0443\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043d", "bluehour", "architektur", "architecture", "cityscape"], "title": "hauptwache"}, "id": "2693037296", "favs": 30, "title": "hauptwache", "sizes": {"Square": {"height": "75", "width": "75", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/sq/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_s.jpg"}, "Small": {"height": "156", "width": "240", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/s/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_m.jpg"}, "Small 320": {"height": "208", "width": "320", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/n/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_n.jpg"}, "Large Square": {"height": "150", "width": "150", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/q/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_q.jpg"}, "Medium 640": {"height": "416", "width": "640", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/z/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_z.jpg"}, "Thumbnail": {"height": "65", "width": "100", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/t/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_t.jpg"}, "Large": {"height": "666", "width": "1024", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/l/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642_b.jpg"}, "Original": {"height": "2782", "width": "4279", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/o/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_957fa4f44e_o.jpg"}, "Medium": {"height": "325", "width": "500", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2693037296/sizes/m/", "source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3018/2693037296_ef78097642.jpg"}}}
