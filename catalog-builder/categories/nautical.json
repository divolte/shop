The park was inscribed on the UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1979, in recognition of its &quot;outstanding natural beauty and undisturbed production of travertine (tufa) through chemical and biological action&quot;. The park represents a phenomenon of karst hydrography.\n\nThe park harbours a grand collection of waterfalls, gallery of lakes, forest and diversity of animal life. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colors, ranging from azure to green, grey or blue. The colors change constantly depending on the quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of sunlight. The sixteen lakes which are formed by natural dams of travertine are separated into upper and lower lakes. About eight km of pathways and wooden walking trails around lakes are accessible to visitors.

Two Royal Caribbean ships were stationed at the White Pass pier.\nThe smaller S.S Legacy is a pocket cruise ship that makes inter-Alaska cruises in summer.  The historic yellow Skagway Street cars are ready to take tourists on a scenic driving tour.\n\nS.S. LEGACY:\nUn-Cruise Adventures added the 88-passenger S.S. Legacy to its fleet in August 2013. The company purchased the vessel, previously named Spirit of '98, from the defunct Cruise West, in August 2011. \n\nAfter a complete overhaul, the 192-foot boat comes complete with carved wood cabinetry and period decor.\n\nThe Legacy was built in 1983 and refurbished in 2013, the ambience aboard the 88-guest S.S. Legacy emulates the old-world charm of an early turn-of-the-century coastal steamer. Exquisitely appointed with period decor, the vessel's carved wooden cabinetry, lounge complete with a full bar, Klondike Dining Room with wine bar, Pesky Barnacle Saloon, hot tub, sauna, fitness equipment, yoga classes, and massage suite are features accessible to all guests. \n\nSKAGWAY STREET CARS:\nSkagway character Martin Itjen came looking for Klondike gold in 1898 and became the local undertaker, Ford dealer, coal deliveryman, and the town\u2019s most celebrated storyteller. In 1923, he gave Alaska\u2019s first motorized sightseeing tour for U.S. President Warren G. Harding in his brightly painted coal truck, jokingly calling it his \u201cStreet Car.\u201d Martin continued touring for decades, delighting summer visitors with his homespun style of humor.\n\nToday, Martin\u2019s tour lives on in Skagway with the help of a talented crew of costumed \u201cStreet Car conductors,\u201d who pass on a century of history, behind-the-scenes tales, and stories of life in small-town Alaska \u2014 just like Martin did. Let us share Skagway\u2019s rich and colorful heritage with you.

For centuries gondolas were the chief means of transportation and most common watercraft within Venice. In modern times the iconic boats still have a role in public transport in the city, serving as traghetti (ferries) over the Grand Canal. They are also used in special regattas (rowing races) held amongst gondoliers. It is similar to punting, except it uses an oar to propel it instead of a pole. Their primary role today, however, is to carry tourists on rides at fixed rates.\n\nFor further information please visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola</a> \n\nAlthough Venice is composed of islands and canals, the Grand Canal is the only really large one. It's shaped like a backwards letter S, and is approximately two miles long. At its widest point, at the Salute/San Marco (southern) end, it is roughly 350 feet wide; the normal width is about half that. The Grand Canal was traditionally the high-rent district in Venice; houses were larger, and decoration was on a much grander scale. This makes sense when you consider that the Canal offers much greater opportunities for everyone to see the buildings facing it. Further, the Grand Canal, affording easier transport and access to shipping, tended to favor the kind of residents who were large-scale merchants--the very ones likely to have more money. For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.bellereti.com/jzimm/Venice/Gcanal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bellereti.com/jzimm/Venice/Gcanal.html</a> \n\nVenice (Italian: Venezia [ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja] ( listen), Venetian: Venexia [ve\u02c8n\u025bsja]) is a city in northeast Italy which is renowned for the beauty of its setting, its architecture and its artworks. It is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.\n\nThe city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers.\n\nThe Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, and spice) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nPlease visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice</a> for further information...", "owner": {"username": "antonychammond", "id": "8525214@N06", "realname": "Tony Hammond"}, "title": "Venice - Gondalas on the Grand Canal", "tags": ["gondala", "grandcanal", "venice", "italy", "canal", "boat", "coth", "mygearandme", "coth5", "flickraward", "bluesail"]}, "favs": 50, "title": "Venice - Gondalas on the Grand Canal"}

Work started on the canal in 1854 and was completed in 1869. The canal also boasts the only functioning lock system in Nova Scotia.\n\nThere is tidal activity at both ends of the canal, and there can be a difference of up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft.) between the water level of the lake and ocean. For this reason, both entrances have double-lock gates. The lock is 91.44 m (301 ft.) long by 14.45 m (47 ft.) wide and can handle vessels with a 4.88 m (16 ft.) draught.\n\nIn the 1630s, enterprising merchants from La Rochelle in France built a small fortified settlement, called Saint Pierre, on a narrow isthmus of land separating the Atlantic Ocean from Bras d'Or Lake. The area had long been travelled by the Mi'kmaq people who portaged their canoes across the isthmus. To protect the new settlement and transportation across the isthmus, the French built a fort on the shore. Both the fort and the settlement were destroyed by the British in 1758 after their capture of Louisbourg.\n\nWith a steadily increasing volume of shipping, plans were soon made to replace the old portage road with a navigation channel. The first feasibility study was commissioned in 1825, and work on the canal began in 1854. A passage about 800 meters (2625ft.) long was cut through the narrowest point of land. After 15 years of digging, blasting and drilling, an opening averaging 30 meters (100 ft.) wide had been cut through a solid granite hill 20 meters (66 ft.) high. This passage was shored up with timbers and planking. Locks were then installed and the canal finally became a reality in 1869. Additions and renovations, widening the channel and lengthening the locks, continued until 1917. In 1985, Parks Canada completed a major project to restore both the Bras d'Or Lake and the Atlantic Ocean entrances to the canal. All kinds of pleasure craft now use the canal during the summer: canoes, schooners and power cruisers. Only occasionally does a commercial vessel pass through these locks that once were so vital to communication and the economy of Cape Breton Island.", "owner": {"username": "archer10 (Dennis) REPOSTING", "id": "22490717@N02", "realname": "Dennis Jarvis"}, "title": "DSC01915 - St. Peters Canal National Historic Site of Canada", "tags": ["stpeters", "canal", "fishing", "boats", "novascotia", "canada", "nex7", "sony", "18200diiiivc", "free", "freepicture", "archer10", "dennis", "jarvis", "dennisgjarvis", "dennisjarvis", "iamcanadian", "history", "locks"]}, "favs": 50, "title": "DSC01915 - St. Peters Canal National Historic Site of Canada"}

Se utiliza una gran red de 250 a 1000 metros de longitud y unos 50 de ancho, que flota y al pasar los peces se cierra.\n\n\nRedes de cerco y redes de copo[editar]\nLas redes de cerco se utilizan para la captura de peces cuya costumbre es nadar formando densos card\u00famenes o bancos de peces, ya sea en la superficie o a media agua, es decir, pel\u00e1gicos, como la anchoveta, la sardina, el at\u00fan, el bonito, la caballa y el jurel. En un principio, estas especies (y en algunos lugares todav\u00eda) eran capturadas mediante artes de enmalle, sardinales y trasmallos; sin embargo, las artes verdaderamente eficaces para esta clase de pesca son las redes de cerco, por las que se han ido sustituyendo.  \n\n\nPurse seine fishing is, as the name suggests, in fencing the fish (sardine, anchovy, horse mackerel and mackerel in particular) or positioning the shoal of fish, determining course and speed, and then proceeding to encircle, letting the network with the panga (small boat big engine), making a circle around the shoal then fencing using the panga, then the back of the net closes capturing fishing. A large network of 250 to 1000 meters in length is used and about 50 meters wide, and floating fish pass is closed.\n \n\n\nSeines and nets snowflake [edit] \nPurse seines are used to catch fish whose custom is swimming forming dense schools or schools of fish, either on the surface or mid-water, ie pelagics such as anchovy, sardine, tuna, bonito, mackerel and horse mackerel. Initially, these species (and in some places still) you were caught using gillnets, trammel nets and sardine; however, truly effective gear for these fisheries are the purse seine nets for which have been replaced. \n \n\n\nP\u00eache \u00e0 la senne est, comme son nom l'indique, dans \nl'escrime le poisson (sardine, anchois, chinchard et maquereau en particulier) ou le positionnement du banc de poissons, la d\u00e9termination de cap et la vitesse, puis de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'encercler, laissant le r\u00e9seau avec le panga (petit bateau gros moteur), faisant un cercle autour du banc alors escrime en utilisant le panga, le fond du filet se referme capturer la p\u00eache.

The luxurious Pearl had to shell out $375,600 to make the pass through the canal. The Disney Magic had held the record from 2008 for its toll of $331,200.

To make the photo I set the ISO to 1600, aperture to f/2.8, and made a 30 second exposure holding the camera by hand against the bridge window.  The window proved pretty steady and the ship itself came out as sharp as could be expected considering engine vibration.  The movement of lights on the horizon is caused by the motion of the ship itself due to a small swell and course correction by the helmsman.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oneeighteen/5577592353/sizes/o/in/photostream/\">LARGE</a>", "owner": {"username": "OneEighteen", "id": "72511036@N00", "realname": "Louis Vest"}, "title": "Phosphorescence", "tags": ["houston", "ship", "channel", "houstonshipchannel", "pilot", "harbor", "port", "nautical", "marine", "maritime", "\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3", "\u8239", "schiff", "schip", "nave", "navire", "\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c", "phosphorescence", "bowwave", "night"]}, "favs": 47, "title": "Phosphorescence"}

The camera was fastened to an outside rail and set to take a photo every six seconds.  Quicktime then assembled the photos into a .mov file that plays back at 12 frames per second.  So, one minute of movie time represents 72 minutes of trip time on the channel.  The first half begins just below the Port of Houston Authority Turning Basin (the very end of the channel) and continues down to Green's Bayou.  The second half takes us from there to Morgan's Point at the head of Galveston Bay.  From there we still have 31.5 miles of channel across the bay to the pilot station outside the Galveston jetties.    \n\nCAMERA SETTINGS were all manual to avoid surprises.  The lens was a Nikon 17-35mm zoomed out to 17mm.   White balance was set to tungsten, manual focus, iso 1600, 1/8 sec/ f/4.  After the first part of the trip where the shore and docks are less dense I bumped the exposure up two stops to 1/4 sec and f/2.8.  The overall result was a little dark for my taste after the deck floodlights were turned off so I added 1.33 gamma to all the photos taken after the deck lights were off.  When I make the 1080 version I'll fool around to make a more gradual transition there and will probably decease the exposure around the last terminal and bridge (on the second video).\n\nIt looks incredibly fast, but we were actually only making 5-6 knots in the first half and no more than 10 knots in the open areas of the second half.  \n\nThis was a Panamax ship, 106 feet wide, and about 600 feet long with 32 feet of draft.\n\n@ 1:13 a seagull is photographed in the upper left quarter making a bright flash - several people asked what that was.\n\nYou can watch the whole 3 minute piece in HQ  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xstd3_0usI\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.</a>\n\nA daylight trip going all the way to the Gulf of Mexico can be found <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oneeighteen/2443170048/\">here.</a>\n\nA similar trip through the Panama Canal can be found <a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1063460/through_panama_canal_in_75..\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\n\n***************************************** MUSIC ***************************************************\nAn incredible number of suggestions about music to go with this piece have been posted here and on the whole 3 minute piece on YouTube.

This is a time lapse video I made using a computer to control an old Olympus camera.  The gear was set to record a 1024x760 photo at medium resolution every six seconds.  To make the video I used Mac's Quicktime Pro program to consolidate and replay the individual photos at 15 frames per second.  The camera was placed on an upside down trash can (my wife is painting the house and my small tripod has mysteriously disappeared).  \n\nThe episode is truncated about half way through the trip due to Flickr's 90sec/150mb video limitations.  The second half of the trip is in the next video over\n\nI tried to figure out how fast the ship appears to be going.  1 frame each 6 seconds played at 15 frames per second yields a 90:1 speed ratio.  So 6-10 knots should look like 540-900 knots, but it doesn't look that fast.  Probably because a ship is so big it throws off your intuition about speed.\n\nThe ship is the Champion Star.  About 600x106' or 180x32m.  So there's about 500' out to the foremast there.\n\nSince it was recorded at 1024x760 I really recommend clicking on the little button on the lower right side of the image above to take advantage of the full screen mode.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nP.S.

The outside of the compass lid reads &quot;Edward VII Compass King &amp; Emporer 1908&quot;. The date, 1908, and the word, &quot;London&quot; is inscribed on the compass rose under the glass. The compass has a fob, as well as a sliding knob to lock the floating needle in place when not in use.\n\nThe poem, Robert Frost's &quot;The Road Less Taken&quot; has been engraved on brass-toned metal and appears to have been attached to the inside cover. This poem dates to 1915 and was not really considered a classic until the mid-1920s. I'm assuming that the inscription was added later, particularly because the font-styles are more modern.\n\nMy husband isn't sure if the compass actually dates to 1908. Negretti &amp; Zambra manufactured compasses, telescopes, monocules, barameters and other scientific items during this time period, but I was unable to find a similar compass style during a fairly comprehensive Internet search.\n\nIf you know anything about vintage compasses, please leave a comment.

The playback is at 10 frames per second so the action is shown at 60 times as fast as it actually happened.  In this case the part of the trip shown lasted 76 minutes (out of a 5 hour trip).  Taken on the upper Houston Ship Channel.\n\nTechnical Info: The Nikon D300 has an &quot;Interval Timer&quot; setting that allows up to 999 photos to be taken at regular intervals.  In this case I set the interval to 6 seconds.  The camera settings were: Manual focus, Manual exposure, 1/4 sec, f/2.8, ISO 800, WB=tungsten, quality=.jpg normal.  The lens was a Nikon 17-35mm f/2.8.  All the manual settings were favored over auto settings so there would be no drastic changes between shots.  My old camera would take a WB=daylight or something else at odd intervals.  The whole sequence was about 760 photos.  I started with a fully charged battery and figured it would poop out after a while, but the process only used up 2 of 5 bars on the battery indicator.  A surprise.  \n\nThe lowest .jpg quality setting for the camera yields a 4288x2848 image at 300 ppi.  That's way too much for video so I fooled around with it and used Photoshop Scripts-&gt;Image Processor to edit the batch of files down to 900x600 at 72 ppi.  Then I used Quicktime Pro to turn the sequence into a .mov file which plays at 10 frames per second.  If anyone knows a better way I'd love to hear from them.", "owner": {"username": "OneEighteen", "id": "72511036@N00", "realname": "Louis Vest"}, "title": "Night Run", "tags": ["houston", "houstonshipchannel", "ship", "pilot", "port", "harbor", "nautical", "maritime", "marine", "video", "timelapse", "docking", "night"]}, "favs": 47, "title": "Night Run"}

We (the pilots) do about 18,000 transits a year.  New Orleans is second with 14-15,000 transits and New York and Los Angeles-Long Beach each do about 9,000.\n\nSo why are we still called the second biggest port?  Or third?  Or forth?  Even our own local newspaper has repeatedly published articles listing Houston in an inferior position as a port.  Los Angeles claims to be the biggest port for container traffic which might be true, but it is only one kind of cargo.  New Orleans makes a more legitimate claim based on cargo tonnage, but that claim includes huge amounts of barge traffic on the Mississippi. But when I think of a port, I think of ships coming and going.  And by that measurement Houston has been first in the nation for ten years.\n\n The lack of appreciation for Houston as a port might have a lot to do with its being overwhelmingly perceived as an oil and gas city... and we are.  That and the flat landscape that makes the ship channel invisible from less than a mile away in most places takes the port out of the ken of most Houstonians.  But when you drive down the industrial corridor of the city what do you see?  Miles of tanks like these.

The camera was fastened to an outside rail and set to take a photo every six seconds.  Quicktime then assembled the photos into a .mov file that plays back at 12 frames per second.  So, one minute of movie time represents 72 minutes of trip time on the channel.  The first half begins just below the Port of Houston Authority Turning Basin (the very end of the channel) and continues down to Green's Bayou.  The second half takes us from there to Morgan's Point at the head of Galveston Bay.  From there we still have 31.5 miles of channel across the bay to the pilot station outside the Galveston jetties.    \n\nCAMERA SETTINGS were all manual to avoid surprises.  The lens was a Nikon 17-35mm zoomed out to 17mm.   White balance was set to tungsten, manual focus, iso 1600, 1/8 sec/ f/4.  After the first part of the trip where the shore and docks are less dense I bumped the exposure up two stops to 1/4 sec and f/2.8.  The overall result was a little dark for my taste after the deck floodlights were turned off so I added 1.33 gamma to all the photos taken after the deck lights were off.  When I make the 1080 version I'll fool around to make a more gradual transition there and will probably decease the exposure around the last terminal and bridge (on the second video).\n\nIt looks incredibly fast, but we were actually only making 5-6 knots in the first half and no more than 10 knots in the open areas of the second half.  \n\nYou can watch the whole 3 minute piece in HQ  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xstd3_0usI\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.</a>\n\nA daylight trip going all the way to the Gulf of Mexico can be found <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oneeighteen/2443170048/\">here.</a>\n\nA similar trip through the Panama Canal can be found <a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1063460/through_panama_canal_in_75..\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.", "owner": {"username": "OneEighteen", "id": "72511036@N00", "realname": "Louis Vest"}, "title": "Night Run II, 2nd Half", "tags": ["houston", "ship", "channel", "houstonshipchannel", "pilot", "harbor", "port", "nautical", "marine", "maritime", "video", "night", "nightrun", "timelapse"]}, "favs": 50, "title": "Night Run II, 2nd Half"}

Through the depiction of the story of Scottish migration to the New World, the Hector Heritage Quay introduces visitors to the history and culture of the area. A series of imaginative and informative displays retell the story of the Ship Hector voyage in 1773. The centerpiece of the attraction is a full scale reproduction of the ship Hector. This three masted, fully rigged ship is found on Pictou's historic waterfront. \n\nA full rigged Fluyt, the Hector (built in Holland before 1750) was employed in local trade in waters of the British Isles as well as the immigrant trade to North America, having made at least one trip ca. 1770 carrying Scottish emigrants to Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHer most famous voyage took place in 1773 with a departure date around July 1, carrying 170 Highlanders who were immigrating to Nova Scotia. The vessel's owner, Mr. Pagan, along with Dr. John Witherspoon, purchased three shares of land near Pictou, Nova Scotia. Pagan and Witherspoon hired John Ross as a recruiting agent for settlers willing to immigrate to Pictou with an offer of free passage, 1 year of free provisions, and a farm. The settlers (23 families, 25 single men) were recruited at Greenock and at Lochbroom (Rossshire) with the majority being from Lochbroom. The settlers that boarded the Hector were poor, &quot;obscure, illiterate crofters and artisans from Northern Scotland, who only spoke Gaelic.&quot; The school teacher, William McKenzie was one of the few passengers on the Hector to speak both Gaelic and English.\n\nThe Hector was an old ship and in poor condition when she left Europe. The arduous voyage to Pictou took 11 weeks, with a gale off Newfoundland causing a 14 day delay. Dysentery and smallpox claimed 18 children among the passengers. The vessel arrived in Pictou Harbour on September 15, landing at Brown's Point, immediately west of the present-day town of Pictou.\n\nThe year's free provisions never materialized for the passengers of the Hector. They had to hurry to build shelter without those provisions before winter set in and starved them.\n\nYear built: ca. 1770\nLocation: Holland\nLength overall: 25.9 m (85 ft)\nBeam: 6.7 m (22 ft)\nGross tonnage: 200\nNumber of masts: 3\nOwner: Mr. Pagan, a merchant in Greenock, Scotland", "owner": {"username": "archer10 (Dennis) REPOSTING", "id": "22490717@N02", "realname": "Dennis Jarvis"}, "title": "DSC01911 - The Hector", "tags": ["pictou", "novascotia", "canada", "nex7", "sony", "18200diiiivc", "free", "freepicture", "archer10", "dennis", "jarvis", "dennisgjarvis", "dennisjarvis", "iamcanadian", "hector", "tallship", "blue", "hectorheritagequay"]}, "favs": 50, "title": "DSC01911 - The Hector"}

Two Royal Caribbean ships were stationed at the White Pass pier.\nThe smaller S.S Legacy is a pocket cruise ship that makes inter-Alaska cruises in summer.  The historic yellow Skagway Street cars are ready to take tourists on a scenic driving tour.\n\nS.S. LEGACY:\nUn-Cruise Adventures added the 88-passenger S.S. Legacy to its fleet in August 2013. The company purchased the vessel, previously named Spirit of '98, from the defunct Cruise West, in August 2011. \n\nAfter a complete overhaul, the 192-foot boat comes complete with carved wood cabinetry and period decor.\n\nThe Legacy was built in 1983 and refurbished in 2013, the ambience aboard the 88-guest S.S. Legacy emulates the old-world charm of an early turn-of-the-century coastal steamer. Exquisitely appointed with period decor, the vessel's carved wooden cabinetry, lounge complete with a full bar, Klondike Dining Room with wine bar, Pesky Barnacle Saloon, hot tub, sauna, fitness equipment, yoga classes, and massage suite are features accessible to all guests. \n\nSKAGWAY STREET CARS:\nSkagway character Martin Itjen came looking for Klondike gold in 1898 and became the local undertaker, Ford dealer, coal deliveryman, and the town\u2019s most celebrated storyteller. In 1923, he gave Alaska\u2019s first motorized sightseeing tour for U.S. President Warren G. Harding in his brightly painted coal truck, jokingly calling it his \u201cStreet Car.\u201d Martin continued touring for decades, delighting summer visitors with his homespun style of humor.\n\nToday, Martin\u2019s tour lives on in Skagway with the help of a talented crew of costumed \u201cStreet Car conductors,\u201d who pass on a century of history, behind-the-scenes tales, and stories of life in small-town Alaska \u2014 just like Martin did. Let us share Skagway\u2019s rich and colorful heritage with you.

It was in company with Portsmouth-based Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond, which is currently in the region.\n\nThe SKASACs are presently exercising with Royal Navy ships in the area.  For the last few years units from the squadron have been deployed to Afghanistan, where their performance in providing airborne support to units on Op HERRICK has been of critical importance.  Using the techniques honed from these deployments they are bolstering surveillance at sea by demonstrating their ability to detect even small contacts at range and report them to friendly units.\n\nThe exercises were carried out while Diamond was conducting maritime security operations in the Gulf Region.  It was also a good experience for the aviation team in the ship to handle the requirements of a different class of aircraft.  \nThis image is available for high resolution download at <a href=\"http://www.defenceimages.mod.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.defenceimages.mod.uk</a> subject to the terms and conditions of the Open Government License at <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/</a>.

My photos are FREE to use, just give me credit and it would be nice if you let me know, thanks. \n\nThis was taken at the Shelbourne Shipyard - interesting reading;\n\nIn January 2008, the folks behind small-ship line American Cruise Lines announced the formation of a new cruise venture called Pearl Seas Cruises, which was to begin worldwide service in 2009 with a brand-new, all-suite ship called Pearl Mist. Hey, big news! New cruise line!\n\nThen problems began to surface. In May 2009, the ship's sea trials ended with the line claiming that deficiencies had been uncovered that required the cancellation of its planned inaugural season. The rest of 2009 came and went. Ditto for 2010. Word filtered out that Pearl Seas was engaged in a dispute with Nova Scotia\u2013based Irving Shipbuilding, which had designed and built the 210-passenger vessel. Now today, the Halifax Chronicle Herald (newspaper) is reporting that Pearl Seas is suing Irving for some $60 million, claiming that the U.S. Coast Guard and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (where the ship is registered) have identified violations of the international Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) standards, which set the safety bar for merchant ships from construction through continuing operation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Lloyd's Register, the ship's classification society (which inspects the vessel for compliance with safety regulations), has still not given Pearl Mist the green light, while the Marshall Islands declined &quot;'to register the vessel under the Marshall Islands flag\u2019 due to material safety issues.&quot;\n\nPearl Seas' suit asks that its contract with Irving be cancelled, and seeks both the return of its $30 million investment in the vessel and an additional $30 million in damages. Meanwhile, Pearl Mist is apparently laid up in Shelbourne, Nova Scotia \u2014 and appears to be going nowhere.\n\nShip Information:\n\nThe intimacy of a yacht. The safety and comfort of a ship. Pearl Mist defines a new style of Luxury Adventure Small Ship Cruising. A brand-new luxury ships with latest technology in navigation, communication, stabilization, and speed, exceeding all of the latest international safety regulations-without sacrificing first-class appointments and meticulous attention to detail.\n\n2010 :Year Built\n2011 :Year Entered Fleet\nMarshall Islands  :Country of Registry\n6,000 Tonnage\n210  Passengers (Double Occupancy)\n6  Passenger Decks\n65  Number of Crew\nAmerican  Officer's Nationality\nInternational  Crew/Hotel Staff\nStaterooms\n108  Total in all Categories\n108  Oceanview w/ Balcony\n2 Accessible Staterooms (all Categories)", "owner": {"username": "archer10 (Dennis) REPOSTING", "id": "22490717@N02", "realname": "Dennis Jarvis"}, "title": "DGJ_3798 - Pearl Mist - sits and waits...(interesting reading)", "tags": ["pearlmist", "ship", "cruise", "shipyard", "shelburne", "lighthouseroute", "novascotia", "canada", "d300", "nikon", "18200vr", "70300mmvr", "free", "freepicture", "archer10", "dennis", "jarvis", "dennisgjarvis", "dennisjarvis", "reflection", "lawsuit", "iamcanadian"]}, "favs": 50, "title": "DGJ_3798 - Pearl Mist - sits and waits...(interesting reading)"}

When you put 40+ ships per day in a 50 mile canal that's what you get?  Coming, going, parked waiting for a time slot-----\n\nThe Kiera crew must have been on a rest break!!  Maybe they are inside taking a &quot;How to be responsible seafarers&quot; course?\n\n05 OCTOBER 2013\n\nOne of the biggest shipping companies in the world has been prosecuted for dumping waste in Cornish waters after being captured on satellite, in what has been called a landmark case in the battle against the pollution of the seas.\n\nA Singaporean-registered Maersk Group tanker was found guilty and fined \u00a322,500 yesterday for dumping a mixture of palm oil and tank cleaning fluid within 12 miles of Land\u2019s End last year - leaving a slick 20 miles long.\n\nThe unique trial at Truro Magistrates Court has been highlighted as the first time satellite footage has been used by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the prosecution of a company for dumping waste illegally in the UK.\n\nThe agency, which is responsible for protecting the nation\u2019s shoreline, had previously been reliant on eyewitness accounts from passing planes and ships for its prosecutions and said the use of satellite was a new \u201cweapon\u201d in their \u201carmoury\u201d.\n\nThe news is expected to please environmentalists too - especially in light of the high-profile PIB scandal earlier this year which left thousands of seabirds dead after they washed up covered in the \u201csticky substance\u201d along the Westcountry coastline.\n\nCaptain Andrew Phillips, the investigating officer in the MCA\u2019s enforcement unit, said it wouldn\u2019t have been able to lead the prosecution if it was not for the satellite.\n\n\u201cPolluters beware,\u201d he said. \u201dThe sea\u2019s not a dumping ground and we\u2019ve got the means prosecute you.\n\n\u201c(In the past) we would not have known anything had been going on, up until now all of our cases have relied on eyewitness evidence or self reporting.\n\n\u201cWhere we have the clear evidence the MCA will take legal action. (The new satellite footage means that) one we can find the polluters, two we can identify them.\n\n\u201cUp until now we were reliant on passing planes and ships reporting to us, where as this gives us UK wide coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another weapon in our armoury.\u201d\n\nThe case in Truro yesterday afternoon represented the first time satellite footage passed to the MCA by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) had been used in a successful conviction.\n\nSpeaking in court for the prosecution, Kevin Elliott, said the MCA had first been alerted by EMSA on February 25 2012 after its satellites detected the tanker Maersk Kiera, registered to Singapore Private Ltd, trailing a slick.\n\nFalmouth Coastguard had contacted the ship but were told on two occasions by its second officer that it was not trailing a slick.\n\nIn a third correspondence, the master of the ship, which was travelling between Liverpool and Latvia, confirmed that tank cleaning and associated discharge of palm oil was being undertaken, however it was outside the 12 mile restriction.\n\nHe said that further communications were made between the operators and MCA but it took 14 months for the company to eventually admit to a breach of UK Pollution Legislation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe rules with limits are there for a reason and a decision was taken by Parliament and the European Convention that this sort of discharge taking place within 12 miles will have a detrimental effect on the environment.\n\n\u201cThe propensity to cause pollution and damage was great.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for the defence, Joe Quain said that although the slick was 20 miles long, only eight to ten miles was inside the 12 mile limit.\n\nHe said that it discharged around 75 cubic metres of waste solution within the limits, which included tank cleaning solution and up to 26 litres of palm oil.\n\nBut Mr Elliott said although there was no direct evidence for the damage caused by the pollution but that the potential was great.\n\nJohn Richardson, the chairman of the bench, fined the owners of the Maersk Kiera, Maersk Tankers Singapore Pte Limited, \u00a315,000 with a \u00a3120 victim surcharge and prosecution costs of \u00a37,404.88.\n\nSentencing, he said: \u201cRegulations against discharge are there for a good reason.\n\n\u201cThere has been little real mitigation offered by the defence. This is a medium to high risk case.\u201d\n\nCaptain Jeremy Smart, head of enforcement at the MCA, said: \u201cThis is the first time satellite imagery has been successfully used as primary evidence in a maritime pollution prosecution by the MCA.\n\n\u201cThe agency will use all means available to identify and prosecute those carrying out illegal discharges..\u201d\n\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Tanker-spied-space-polluting-seas-Cornwall/story-19889142-detail/story.html#ixzz36YjtkqAu\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Tanker-spied-space-polluting...</a>\nRead more at <a href=\"http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Tanker-spied-space-polluting-seas-Cornwall/story-19889142-detail/story.html#Vq3f2UcmkT8Pyv2x.99\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Tanker-spied-space-polluting...</a>\n\nIMO: 9431305\nName: MAERSK KIERA\nMMSI: 566234000\nType: OIL/CHEMICAL TANKER\nGross Tonnage: 24463 t\nSummer DWT: 39724 t\nBuild: 2011\nFlag: SINGAPORE", "owner": {"username": "Ted's photos - For me & you", "id": "90955804@N04", "realname": "Ted McGrath"}, "title": "2014 - Panama Canal Transit - Maersk Kiera - 1 of 3", "tags": ["panamacanal", "tedsphotos", "nikon", "nikonfx", "d600", "maerskkiera", "maersk", "singapore", "canal", "lake", "lakegatun", "gatunlake", "panama", "boat", "ship", "oiltanker", "oilchemicaltanker", "kiera", "water", "lifeboat", "antenna", "railings", "star", "flag", "flags", "panamaflag", "steps", "stairs", "waterline", "doors", "windows", "exhaustpipe", "blue", "ixzz36yjtkqauvq3f2ucmkt8pyv2x99", "mast", "logo", "exhaust", "5photosaday", "artbook"]}, "favs": 30, "title": "2014 - Panama Canal Transit - Maersk Kiera - 1 of 3"}
