Not too close - 4hr drive to location in South Moravia, Czech Rep. so we had to wake up at 4am and got back home too tired around 11pm. But it was so worth it. Location was stunning and well known by the pro photographer who was leading the workshop. And he even managed to secure ideal weather somehow LOL. Area was full of rolling hills that are used for agriculture so the fields were vibrant and varied. Sky was nice and blue almost all day with those puffy white clouds moving very fast in the strong wind and that resulted in an amazing light&amp;shadow show on the fields.\n\nAt one moment I spotted a triangle illuminated in the sea of shadows so I immediately turned the ball head on my tripod, prefocused manually, adjusted polarizer &amp; 1-stop hard edge grad filter, set the exposure and fired. Post process included only the adjustment of the levels to achieve better contrast, tiny bit of saturation and square crop.\n\nDidn't have time to play with all the photos yet but this one is my personal winner - at least I think so ;) Anyways... expect more photos soon.\n\nThanks for looking!\nYour feedback is always appreciated ;)", "owner": {"id": "30928175@N00", "realname": "Martin Sojka", "username": "Martin Sojka .. www.VisualEscap.es"}}}

I had seen an unusual SILVER water tower in the distance. Normally these structures are various shades of white.\n\nAs I made my way closer to the tower, I spotted this open field of freshly cut grass that had been newly baled. The sun had only been up for about 15 minutes, so it was still casting this golden light over the pasture.\n\nI composed this landscape so that your eye starts with the largest hay bale on the left, then leading it to the hay bales on the right and then following the trail of hay bales as they zigzag all the way up to the water tower in the distance.\n\n<b>Post Processing</b>\nThis image was processed mostly in Lightroom...I brought down some of the highlights in the sky, warmed the white balance and added a bit of vibrancy and clarity. I used the 'high pass' technique for for selectively sharpening different parts of the image in Photoshop.\n\n<i>Happy shooting my friends!</i>", "owner": {"id": "91164391@N05", "realname": "Moose Winans", "username": "Moose Winans"}}}

I've spent most of my photography time researching and setting up digital darkroom at home lately. Storing and processing photos on the laptop was becoming a nightmare as you can imagine. New Dell with 64bit Win 7 is running smooth so far and I paired it with great Eizo screen. So we're slowly moving our growing collection of pictures to this new home computer and there are hundreds of pictures still waiting to be processed from the last few months.\n\nWe're having rainy May here in Slovakia. And by rainy I mean that it was raining every single day. It's getting at least slightly better as the rains are now scattered during the days. So one can go outside right after the rain and admire vivid cultivated fields in a strong contrast with the blue sky and white puffy clouds. Lush green is in harmony with yellow blooming rape everywhere you look.\n\nScenery on this photo is quite close to my home - just a few minutes drive - and it was captured in all it's beauty on Saturday afternoon just after the rain.\n\nI will be posting more frequently again because processing is fun again ;) there are photos from Slovakia as well as from Barcelona and Venice waiting to be published.\n\nOlympus E-30, Zuiko 12-60, LEE GND, Heliopan Polarizer, Gitzo Tripod\n\nThanks for looking!\nYour feedback is always appreciated ;)\n<a href=\"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=30928175@N00&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200\" rel=\"nofollow\">Subscribe to my photostream</a>", "owner": {"id": "30928175@N00", "realname": "Martin Sojka", "username": "Martin Sojka .. www.VisualEscap.es"}}}

Immediately after I came out of the Canyon I flew low over the whole of my route. It was an interesting experience. But that was all. Sight was the only sense I could use. And the difference between flying over the Grand Canyon and living in it is like the difference between, on one hand, seeing a beautiful woman in a bikini and, on the other, making deeply satisfying love to her, with all her warmth and smoothness and fragrance and murmurings and movement.&quot;  Colin Fletcher\n\nThe Nankoweap Trail descends 6,040 feet in 14 miles from the Saddle Mountain trailhead to Nankoweap Creek and on to the Colorado River. It is considered to be the hardest of the trails in the Canyon. You have to carry and cache water as there is none in the 11 miles between the Trailhead and Nankoweap Creek. &quot;The Scary Part&quot; is a section that is 6 inches wide under a sheer cliff with a couple of hundred foot drop punishing the slightest misstep.  Getting across &quot;The Scary Part&quot; with a full pack is a challenge that frightens many away. \nThought to be an Ancestral Puebloan trail, John Wesley Powell supervised the development of the Nankoweap Trail in 1882 as a means to allow geologists access to the area. Interest in the trail revived after Harvey Butchart wrote his Treks I guide. See also John Annerino's &quot;Hiking the Grand Canyon&quot; published by the Sierra Club. \n\nWe hiked in from Saddle Mountain.  We had a nice time with a private rafting group on the beach. \n\nArizona Passages\n\nView Large on Black\n<a href=\"http://fiveprime.org/blackmagic.cgi?id=2039283422&amp;url=http://fiveprime.org/flickr_hvmnd.cgi?search_domain=User;textinput=Al_HikesAZ;search_type=Search User;photo_number=50;photo_type=250;sort=Interestingness;page=1;tag_mode=;blackmagic=l;notarget=1#pic2039283422&amp;user=&amp;flickrurl=\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiveprime.org/blackmagic.cgi?id=2039283422&amp;url=http:/...</a>", "owner": {"id": "7202153@N03", "realname": "", "username": "Al_HikesAZ"}}}

Not too far from me, sits Durdle Door; part of the fabled Jurassic Coast line of southern England. The cliffs you see in this image were formed over 180 million years ago, and washed up upon the coast have been various dinosaurs that I sadly did not get to see today :). Its one of the places in this slowly dying country that still give you some element of pride, some facet of time and place. You see it in so many other countries, places of intrigue and history. In the UK, we are limited in what we can work with and normally, it takes a great photographer to carve out a beautiful piece of art from what we are normally faced with. At Durdle Door, this is most certainly not the case.\n\nThe image you see here, I took about 2 hours ago; just before the sun decided to bugger off for the day. It is a 5 shot merged image, using a circular polariser and a 0.9 ND Grad filter. Colours like this are almost impossible to reproduce without a polariser and due to me being out in the midday sun, an ND Grad was a must to not over-expose the sky whilst still correctly exposing the rocks and grass.", "owner": {"id": "44133834@N02", "realname": "", "username": "Lies Thru a Lens"}}}

The backpacking took about twice as long as expected.  I couldn't stop myself from holding up every few minutes to set up for another photo.  It was irresistible!  \n\nIn other news, I've cleaned up and updated the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com/trey-ratcliff/\" rel=\"nofollow\">About Me</a>&quot; page here on the site.  That thing gets longer and longer... I'm sure it looks like I'm some kind of egomaniac!

Stopped in Te Anau for morning tea and to buy some lunch for our day trip. We we will be staying at Te Anau for the night.\n\nArrived at Milford Sounds just in time for our boat trip. Day five of our fast trip around the South Island with my friends from the UK. November 5, 2013 New Zealand. \n\n\nMilford Sound (M\u0101ori: Piopiotahi) is a fjord in the south west of New Zealand's South Island, within Fiordland National Park, Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) Marine Reserve, and the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage site. It has been judged the world's top travel destination in an international survey (the 2008 Travelers' Choice Destinations Awards by TripAdvisor) and is acclaimed as New Zealand's most famous tourist destination. Rudyard Kipling had previously called it the eighth Wonder of the World.\n\nMilford Sound is named after Milford Haven in Wales, while the Cleddau River which flows into the sound is also named for its Welsh namesake. The M\u0101ori named the sound Piopiotahi after the thrush-like piopio bird, now extinct. Piopiotahi means &quot;a single piopio&quot;, harking back to the legend of M\u0101ui trying to win immortality for mankind - when Maui died in the attempt, a piopio was said to have flown here in mourning.\n\nMilford Sound runs 15 kilometres inland from the Tasman Sea at Dale Point (also named after a location close to Milford Haven in Wales) - the mouth of the fiord - and is surrounded by sheer rock faces that rise 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) or more on either side. Among the peaks are The Elephant at 1,517 metres (4,977 ft), said to resemble an elephant's head, and The Lion, 1,302 metres (4,272 ft), in the shape of a crouching lion.\n\nMilford Sound sports two permanent waterfalls all year round, Lady Bowen Falls and Stirling Falls. After heavy rain however, many hundreds of temporary waterfalls can be seen running down the steep sided rock faces that line the fiord. They are fed by rain water drenched moss and will last a few days at most once the rain stops.\n\nWith a mean annual rainfall of 6,813 mm (268 in) on 182 days a year, a high level even for the West Coast, Milford Sound is known as the wettest inhabited place in New Zealand and one of the wettest in the world. Rainfall can reach 250 mm (10 in) during a span of 24 hours. The rainfall creates dozens of temporary waterfalls (as well as a number of major, more permanent ones) cascading down the cliff faces, some reaching a thousand metres in length. Smaller falls from such heights may never reach the bottom of the sound, drifting away in the wind.\n\nAccumulated rainwater can, at times, cause portions of the rain forest to lose their grip on the sheer cliff faces, resulting in tree avalanches into the sound. The regrowth of the rain forest after these avalanches can be seen in several locations along the sound.\nTaken From and for More Info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milford_Sound\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milford_Sound</a>\n\nAny one interested in following our trip around the South Island.. here is a map: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wises.co.nz/l/lewis+pass/#c/-41.801671/172.516537/8/&quot;", "owner": {"id": "48627921@N05", "realname": "Jocelyn Kinghorn", "username": "Jocey K"}}}

I have been there several times in the past, usually on bright sunny and hot days. This time was different - I hit the park as a winter storm was clearing in December 2012. It was very cold and windy, even for an Alaskan. The rain had just stopped and it looked like more was on the way. I expected the worst but everything turned out great - the clouds really brought out the colors, and some sun breaks (very few) really helped the lighting. I had the park to myself for about 4 hours - there were very few people out and about. Wow - what a great day! \n\nThis sounds odd but I dedicated this folder to a young lass in LV named Leah - she is a brilliant redhead that I was lucky enough to shoot with twice on this trip, and at prior Renaissance Festivals; she is a lovely redhead, great personality - both wild and serene, and very curvy - just like the roads and landscape at Valley of Fire. She is just an all around great person and she really encouraged me to go to the park despite the weather - thanks Leah", "owner": {"id": "72213316@N00", "realname": "Frank Kovalchek", "username": "Alaskan Dude"}}}

Cheers.\n\n\nI'll let you in on a little secret.  If you want to get the best landscape photos you have to work at it.  You need to do your research.  Where are the best views?  Where have the masters positioned themselves to get the best shot?  Can you find a better place?  How will the sun hit the landscape at dawn... what about dusk?  Do you need to hike into the place?  Can you just pull up in a car and snap a shot?  What time is the sunrise?  All these factors go into taking a landscape photo.  It requires patience and research.  It also requires waking up early. However, if done correctly, the final product is well worth it.  \n\nI did a little research before heading into Teton National Park.  There are so many photo capturing points in this park that I had to pick one for the sunrise.  I've always admired the Ansel Adams shot of Grand Teton with the Snake River in the foreground.  It's a classic (I've included his photo below).  My father and I woke up at 5AM after camping on the northern side of the park.  It was a 30 minute drive to the Snake River Outlook.  We were making good time until a herd of buffalo decided to obstruct the road in front of us.  I got a little worried.  They eventually made their way off the road and we made it on time.  Every photographer has their own rendition of how they see a particular shot.  Mine is distinctly different from Ansel Adams', but that's the beauty of art.  No one sees the world with the same mindset or eyes (and thank God).", "owner": {"id": "44028103@N07", "realname": "Chris Ford", "username": "WanderingtheWorld (www.ChrisFord.com)"}}}

The hour was around sunset and then I suddenly saw this enormous field of sunflowers... it was just sitting there... with no one taking photos of it... I thought it was a shame so pulled over and ran out into the field to get some shots before the sun dipped below the horizon.\n\nThese sunflowers were TALL.  They must have been 6 feet off the ground.  To get the shot, I extended the tripod, kept the legs together, put the camera on a 5 second timer, and hoisted it in the air again and again until I finally found the angle I wanted.  \n\nFor you cool photo-nerds (like me), I kept the ISO at 320 and EV+2.  The lens was at 14mm and the ap at 4.8.

The Coalition is charged to facilitate the environmental restoration of the watersheds most severely impacted by the recent High Park and Hewlett Gulch fires. An immediate focus will be reseeding and mulching high priority areas to mitigate erosion and impacts to water quality and local fish populations.  You can see some of the mulching efforts in the image, the golden-shaded areas are where straw mulch has already been dropped.\n\nIf you are interested in getting involved with the restoration effort, there will be a <b>community meeting on the High Park Fire tonight from 5:00 - 7:00 pm at The Lincoln Center in Fort Collins</b>.  I will be there with a booth for CNHP discussing impacts to rare and sensitive species.

Have I said that before?  Doesn't it go without saying by now?\n\nYou really get to know a set of mountains when you have to hike <em>around</em> them.  Fortunately, in the middle of these death marches, I was able to stop and drink in some of the scenery.  It took a lot longer than necessary to get to the destination, but at least I arrived with a camera full of photos.  That beautiful peak in the distance is Fitz Roy.  I was very lucky to see it, because 90% of the time it's covered with clouds.\n\nSo, last night something else lucky happened! Here are the high points:\n-  I did an interview that aired on NBC at 10 PM here in Austin.  The segment was all about HDR and turned out really well.   Jim Swift interviewed me and he did a great job editing together a nice little story.

For once, the world is not littered with people and for the briefest of moments, the world is entirely yours. It was with this thought that I found myself trekking up the side of this hill at 7am on the 25th December, waiting patiently for the sun to break. Eventually, it broke free of the clouds and wrestled itself high enough in the sky to illuminate Colmer's Hill, this beautiful natural hill on the edge of Dorset. Just to the right of frame is the Dorset coast and the town of Bridport, giving birth to one of the most amazing sunrises I have ever seen.

We are not sure yet, but we think there is a special kind of Tyrannosaurus Rex that has been uncovered near Rudyard, Montana.   Jack has his dig team out there, so we are going to camp out with them for a while and help with the dig... we are mega excited.\n\nFor a few nights before the dig, I took the family unit here to nearby Glacier National Park.  We stayed at the Many Glacier Inn, which is this 1930's Swiss-style chalet on a beautiful lake looking out at Mount Grinnell and several glaciers.\n\nI woke up early in the morning to get this shot, while the rest of my family and the inn was still asleep.  As usual, I had my ipod on full blast while I took in the scene and snapped away.\n\nIf you look at the large size, down at the bottom, you can see all the rocks through the crystal-clear glacial lake.\n\nfrom <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a> \nI have a tutorial at <a href=\"http://stuckincustoms.com/2006/06/06/548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">stuckincustoms.com/2006/06/06/548/</a> that you might enjoy...", "owner": {"id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff", "username": "Stuck in Customs"}}}
