It wasn't at all obvious when he was a kitten that he'd even live, let alone thrive.\n\nRight after my cat Skip died and I was wanting a kitten,  the animal control officer brought a mom and her two male kittens to our vet clinic.  I had always wanted a ginger cat and there was Mack - ginger, cute, playful, out-going, and healthy.  Then there was Jimmy.  I had't seen many buff-colored cats and he just looked like a pale imitation of Mack.   He not only looked drab to me, but he was sick and therefore listless and not nearly as playful or social.  I went back and forth about which kitten to adopt - the healthy, playful, ginger kitten (the one I really wanted), or the sick, homely one that I knew no one else would want.  Well, of course I adopted both.\n\nNot only did Jimmy (and eventually Mack) have a horrible case of feline herpes, he also had coccidia, giardia, a urinary track infection, crystals, conjunctivitis, diarrhea and congestion, but the day they came home, Mack also scratched Jimmy's cornea so badly it got ulcerated.  During those first few &quot;getting to know you&quot; weeks, Jimmy was on eight different medications, four of which were eye meds that had to be given at least four times a day (for the first few days after the scratch, he had two eye meds that had to be given every hour for 24 hours).   There was a point when euthanizing him almost seemed more humane.\n\nAs you can see, Jimmy is no longer a pale imitation of anyone.\n\nBest on black.", "owner": {"username": "Kerri Lee Smith", "id": "77654185@N07", "realname": ""}, "title": "Jimmy's story"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_8d1083589c_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/o/", "height": "3076", "width": "1927"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/m/", "height": "500", "width": "313"}, "Large 1600": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_af507f39c6_h.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/h/", "height": "1600", "width": "1002"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/s/", "height": "240", "width": "150"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/n/", "height": "320", "width": "200"}, "Large 2048": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_6c61e6df22_k.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/k/", "height": "2048", "width": "1283"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/l/", "height": "1024", "width": "641"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/z/", "height": "640", "width": "401"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/t/", "height": "100", "width": "63"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Medium 800": {"source": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8493989266_994bf73115_c.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/77654185@N07/8493989266/sizes/c/", "height": "800", "width": "501"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "Jimmy's story", "id": "8493989266"}

Its populations have been estimated at 1,706\u20131,909 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 163\u2013253 in Nepal and 67\u201381 in Bhutan. Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend, and none of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals.\n\nBengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomen Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomen Panthera tigris tigris.

This &quot;red dog&quot;, is an animal which lives in packs. The dhole is something of an enigma. It doesn't fit neatly into any of the sub-families (i.e. the foxes or wolf-like dogs) and is classified in a genus of its own - Cuon.The Asiatic wild dog generally hunts in the daytime, and their prey ranges from lizards and rodents to wild sheep to animals as large as water buffalo. Small prey are caught by any part of the body and killed with a quick shake; larger ones are attacked from behind and killed ruthlessly but effectively by disembowelling. They also scavenge, and have been known to drive a tiger from its kill!

I've taken photos of a lot of monkeys.  They are all over SE Asia and India, so I always pay special attention to them.  I suppose that, as a Westerner, I'm just used to seeing monkeys in zoos.  So whenever I see them running all over creation, it always makes me laugh.  I chase 'em around and take photos like a nut.  These two, however, I snuck up on.  It's not easy to sneak up on a monkey, mind you.  But these two were really into each other.  I did a low approach like a Navy SEAL to get as close as I could.  The female noticed me at the last second, and I grabbed this shot before they started to run away.  \n\nThis was shot at 70mm, which was maximum zoom for my 28-70mm lens.  The f-stop was at 2.8, which allows me as much light as possible in a tight focus plane.  I kept the ISO at 100 for a clean shot with no noise.  There was enough light for a quick shutter speed of 1/250.\n\nfrom my daily photo blog at <a href=\"http://www.stuckincustoms.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stuckincustoms.com</a>", "owner": {"username": "Stuck in Customs", "id": "95572727@N00", "realname": "Trey Ratcliff"}, "title": "Grooming and Bugs"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_6234238936_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/o/", "height": "2810", "width": "3552"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/m/", "height": "396", "width": "500"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/l/", "height": "810", "width": "1024"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/z/", "height": "506", "width": "640"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/s/", "height": "190", "width": "240"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/n/", "height": "253", "width": "320"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1127/858339201_4e4104506a_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/858339201/sizes/t/", "height": "79", "width": "100"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "Grooming and Bugs", "id": "858339201"}

I hope it gives you some new tricks! I consider myself very lucky to have a network of great photographers around the world.  I met most of them through Flickr, where we are constantly commenting and giving feedback on one another's photos.  This has enabled me to meet up with great photographers wherever I travel, and they are great people to hang out with because they already know the prettiest places around where they live!\n\n One of the people I was lucky to shoot with was Rebekka in Iceland.  We met at a coffee shop in Reykjavik and talked about where to go shoot.  We jumped in her car and drove a while until we reached a fjord.  Nearby were these horses running around like wild beasts.  They have no fear of humans, and we were able to go right up to them.  Their hair is very long, and I'm sure it evolved from the hyper-cold whipping winds around the edges of the sea.  \n\nI don't shoot a lot of animals, because I find it hard to improve upon what other great animal photographers have done in the past.  However, here is a tip for shooting animals.  It's kind of a lame trick, but it always works.  Use a wide-angle lens and get in close.  It always makes the head look really big and cute.  Humans love big-headed animals and it always makes them smile.  Why this is, I have no idea...  Note this trick also kinda works with babies.\n\nSeriously, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebba/\">Rebekka</a> for a great day tooling around the fjords of Iceland.\n\nOh, and yes....

It is a bovid, and the smallest member of Oryx genus, native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s, but was saved in zoos and private preserves and reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980.\n\nIn 1986, the Arabian oryx was classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List, and in 2011 it was the first animal to revert to Vulnerable status after previously being listed as extinct in the wild.

Here is her profile:-\n\n'Brought to the door, relationship breakup. Guy working long hours away from home and can no longer care for her. Fairly good condition on admit, although over weight and some matted tufts on her back. You will no doubt need to seek this girl out. A quiet girl who keeps herself very much to herself. Not had a terribly sociable start to her life we suspect. A little bit of an introvert but we're sure she will improve. Take some time with this feline and get to know her. Away from the stresses of the rescue we feel Bessie will blossom into a loving and affectionate cat.

No Parque das Aves voc\u00ea vivenciar\u00e1 um contato direto com mais de 1020 aves, abrangendo cerca de 150 esp\u00e9cies diferentes.  S\u00e3o 16,5 hectares de exuberante Mata Atl\u00e2ntica mantidos para formar o melhor habitat para nossos animais.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria do Parque das Aves come\u00e7a no sudoeste da \u00c1frica, em uma cidade costeira na Nam\u00edbia, onde a fam\u00edlia Croukamp ganhou um filhote de Papagaio-do-Congo, o qual logo despertou o amor pelas aves em Dennis Croukamp.\n\nAnos depois, a fam\u00edlia mudou-se e um amigo sugeriu a Dennis que se mudassem para Foz do Igua\u00e7u para construir um parque de crocodilos. Dennis replicou: &quot;Eu gosto de aves. Iremos criar um Parque das Aves.&quot;\n\nAliado a seus amigos, Dennis viajou para o Brasil e, ap\u00f3s receber todas as licen\u00e7as necess\u00e1rias, adquiriu 16 hectares de floresta subtropical entre o rio Igua\u00e7u e a rodovia que leva \u00e0s Cataratas do Igua\u00e7u, ao lado de onde hoje fica o Parque Nacional do Igua\u00e7u. Sua esposa Anna, m\u00e9dica-veterin\u00e1ria, adquiriu uma c\u00f3pia do livro &quot;Portugu\u00eas em tr\u00eas meses&quot; e estudou nossa l\u00edngua.\n\nO primeiro desafio foi remover do terreno as toneladas de detritos acumulados ao longo dos anos. Toda vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o invasora foi retirada e, em seu lugar, foram plantadas centenas de \u00e1rvores nativas. O pr\u00e9dio administrativo, a loja e a lanchonete foram constru\u00eddos por um empreiteiro.\n\nAnna adentrou na mata fechada em busca dos lugares ideais para os recintos e criou trilhas pela floresta para uni-los. Gra\u00e7as ao esfor\u00e7o de diversas pessoas que se uniram \u00e0 causa, o Parque ganhava forma. Em 1\u00ba de novembro de 1993, Dennis e Anna come\u00e7aram a constru\u00e7\u00e3o do que se tornaria o Parque das Aves.\n\nAs primeiras aves chegaram a partir de doa\u00e7\u00f5es ou empr\u00e9stimos de zool\u00f3gicos brasileiros; animais confiscados foram enviados pelo Ibama. Esp\u00e9cies subtropicais de todos os continentes foram importadas. O borbolet\u00e1rio nasceu da vinda de outro amigo da fam\u00edlia Croukamp para Foz do Igua\u00e7u.\n\nO Parque das Aves foi inaugurado no dia 6 de outubro de 1994, 11 meses ap\u00f3s Dennis e Anna terem desembarcado no Brasil. Desde ent\u00e3o, o Parque n\u00e3o para de crescer gra\u00e7as a um time de brasileiros que se dedica a continuar os sonhos de Dennis.\n\nAtualmente o Parque das Aves \u00e9 o maior parque de aves da Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\nFonte: <a href=\"http://www.parquedasaves.com.br/pt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.parquedasaves.com.br/pt/</a>\n\nEnglish:\n\nThe Bird Park is an essential for anyone visiting Iguassu Falls, located near the Iguazu Falls, in Iguazu National Park tour. At the Bird Park you will experience direct contact with over 1020 birds, covering about 150 different species. Are 16.5 acres of lush Atlantic Forest kept to form the best habitat for our animals.\n\nThe story begins the Bird Park in southwest Africa, a coastal town in Namibia, where the family gained a Croukamp Puppy Puffin Congo, which soon sparked a love for birds in Dennis Croukamp.\n\nYears later, the family moved and a friend suggested that Dennis moved into Foz do Iguacu to build a crocodile park. Dennis replied: &quot;I like birds We will create a bird park..&quot;\n\nAllied to his friends, Dennis traveled to Brazil and, after receiving all necessary licenses, acquired 16 acres of subtropical forest between the Igua\u00e7u River and the highway leading to Iguazu Falls, next to where today is the National Park of Igua\u00e7u. His wife Anna, medical, veterinary, acquired a copy of the book &quot;Portuguese in three months&quot; and studied our language.\n\nThe first challenge was to remove the land tons of debris accumulated over the years. All invasive vegetation was removed and in its place were planted hundreds of native trees. The administrative building, shop and cafeteria were built by a contractor.\n\nAnna entered the thick jungle in search of the ideal places for pens and created trails through the woods to unite them. Thanks to the efforts of several people who have joined the cause, the park took shape. On 1 November 1993, Dennis and Anna began construction of what would become the Bird Park.\n\nThe first birds arrived from donations or loans from Brazilian zoos; confiscated animals were sent by IBAMA. Subtropical species from all continents were imported. The butterfly was born the coming of another friend of Croukamp family to Foz do Igua\u00e7u.\n\nThe Bird Park was opened on October 6, 1994, 11 months after Dennis and Anna have landed in Brazil.

I love how his head is up. Photo taken in the Laguna Hedionda in the Bolivian Altiplano. \n\nThe James's Flamingo (Phoenicopterus jamesi), also known as the Puna Flamingo, is a South American flamingo, named for Harry Berkeley James. It breeds on the high Andean plateaus of Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. It is related to the Andean Flamingo, and the two are often placed in the genus Phoenicoparrus.\n\nIt is a small and delicate flamingo, approximately 3 feet in height. Its plumage is pale pink, with bright carmine streaks around the neck and on the back. When perched a small amount of black can be seen in the wings. There is bright red skin around the eye. The legs are brick-red and the bill is bright yellow with a black tip.

It is the day Shiva declared his younger son Ganesha as superior to all the gods. Ganesha is widely worshipped as the god of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune and traditionally invoked at the beginning of any new venture or at the start of travel.\n\nThe festival is observed in the Hindu calendar month of Bhaadrapada, starting on the shukla chaturthi (fourth day of the waxing moon period). The date usually falls between 20 August and 15 September. The festival lasts for 10 days, ending on Anant Chaturdashi (fourteenth day of the waxing moon period).\nWhile celebrated all over India, it is most elaborate in western and southern India. Outside India, it is celebrated widely in Nepal and by Hindus in the United States, Canada and Fiji.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Chaturthi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> \n\n<b>Follow me @ <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112233299343248188738/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google+</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/vinoth27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/vcphotography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a></b>", "owner": {"username": "VinothChandar", "id": "44345361@N06", "realname": "Vinoth Chandar"}, "title": "Happy Ganesh Chaturthi"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_7d0b9e7e80_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/o/", "height": "1152", "width": "768"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/m/", "height": "500", "width": "333"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/l/", "height": "1024", "width": "683"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/z/", "height": "640", "width": "427"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/s/", "height": "240", "width": "160"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/n/", "height": "320", "width": "213"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6102016223_9e4d07170a_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinothchandar/6102016223/sizes/t/", "height": "100", "width": "67"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "Happy Ganesh Chaturthi", "id": "6102016223"}

Although it sounds similar to the Spanish running of the bulls, it is quite different. In Jallikattu, the bull is not killed or harmed and the 'matadors' are not supposed to use any weapon. Instead its the matadors are the ones who get killed or harmed. Till last year the matadors used to pull the tails of the bulls or they would jump on the bull as a pack of 5 or 10 to tame it. This way the animals were actually harmed. But the Supreme Court of India changed the rules this year to curb animal torture. \n\nIn fact now it can be called as &quot;Bull Ride&quot; because as per the new rules, the matador should hold on to the bull from the entry point to an area about hundred feet away. He will be declared winner if he achieves that. No body should touch the tail and not more than 2 people can try to hold on to the bull.\n\nJallikattu is held in the villages of Tamil Nadu as a part of the village festival. The festivals are held from January to July every year.

Her mate died about three years ago and she's been alone in her large compound ever since.  I've asked and it turns out that there have simply not been any Coyotes for the Zoo to take in.  Our Zoo takes wounded, orphaned, and disabled animals. \n\nBut this Coyote comes up to me at the fence to say &quot;hello&quot; and when she's really feeling good, she'll play the &quot;fence game&quot; with me where she runs up and down the fence like a pup... looking for me to chase her.  \n\nWith only a few zoo keepers around, and few visitors, I can talk with the animals and no one is around to stare at me :) ... makes Winter a great time to visit the Zoo!", "owner": {"username": "Douglas Brown", "id": "11556508@N00", "realname": "Doug Brown"}, "title": "Lonely Coyote"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_7719d6d164_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/o/", "height": "3744", "width": "5616"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/m/", "height": "333", "width": "500"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/l/", "height": "683", "width": "1024"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/z/", "height": "427", "width": "640"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/s/", "height": "160", "width": "240"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/n/", "height": "213", "width": "320"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6380363663_b0c6878725_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougbrown47/6380363663/sizes/t/", "height": "67", "width": "100"}}, "favs": 38, "title": "Lonely Coyote", "id": "6380363663"}

CITES Appendix II listed.\n\nRelatives: Hyacinth macaw\n\nDescription: Like other Amazona parrots, this Ecuadorian species is mainly green with a red front to the head and paler feathers towards the crown. There are 27 species of Amazona parrots, all of which are green in colour and native to the the Americas. In fact, it was Christopher Columbus himself who apparently gave the name 'Amazon' to a green, short-winged parrot that he brought back to Europe after his first voyage to the New World.\n\nThey have exceptionally powerful beaks and a very dexterous tongue. With these tools they are able to eat all kinds of fruit and remove tough nut shells with ease.\n\nLifestyle: The lilacine Amazon prefers humid tropical forests. They are shy, gentle birds and have been know to hide behind foliage until an intruder leaves.\n\nFamily &amp; friends: Most Amazona parrots spend time in small groups. They are usually seen flying in pairs. In the evening, they gather in small communal roosting sites.\n\nKeeping in touch: Parrots in captivity are famed for their ability to learn to speak. In the wild they have a range of calls, particularly shrieks and screams, used when flying between fruiting trees and during courtship.\n\nGrowing up: Two to four eggs are laid in a tree hole. The eggs hatch after three weeks and the young fledge after a further two months in the nest.\n\nConservation news: Once it was discovered, traders and sailors began capturing these parrots and exporting them back to Europe. Those that survived the long sea journey often ended up in pubs and bars where they imitated noises such as spitting, coughing, snoring and learnt a vocabulary of swear words. Once these expressions had been picked up, the owners found the birds almost impossible to retrain!\n\nIn addition to the pet trade, South American Indians have traditionally hunted Amazona parrots for food. Some species are also so abundant that they are considered to be pests by farmers and shot on sight.

It is classified as critically endangered, with a total world population estimated to be about 250 mature individuals.\n\nThe main prey of the Northwest African Cheetah are antelopes which have adapted to an arid environment, such as the addax, Dorcas Gazelle, Rhim Gazelle, and Dama Gazelle. It may also take smaller animals such as hares. These cheetahs can subsist without direct access to water, obtaining water indirectly from the blood of their prey", "owner": {"username": "Steve Wilson - over 5 million views Thanks !!", "id": "26811962@N05", "realname": ""}, "title": "NorthWest African Cheetah"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_fb96276f70_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/o/", "height": "1029", "width": "1300"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/m/", "height": "396", "width": "500"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/l/", "height": "811", "width": "1024"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/z/", "height": "507", "width": "640"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/s/", "height": "190", "width": "240"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Medium 800": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_c.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/c/", "height": "634", "width": "800"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/n/", "height": "253", "width": "320"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14846381095_8fae3439f2_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/pokerbrit/14846381095/sizes/t/", "height": "79", "width": "100"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "NorthWest African Cheetah", "id": "14846381095"}

With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30\u201350% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.\n\nRead more :\n<a href=\"http://goo.gl/KuFgUI\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/KuFgUI</a>\n<a href=\"http://goo.gl/sRtgyq\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/sRtgyq</a>\n\nDD.CAP.2014.10.06.000067\n\u00a9 Dilan Damith Prasanga | 2014\nUpload time 2014.10.15 - 9.45AM", "owner": {"username": "Dilan Damith Prasanga's", "id": "28326885@N03", "realname": ""}, "title": "\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dba\u0dcf - Lion"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_4329bc224c_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/o/", "height": "5184", "width": "3456"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/m/", "height": "500", "width": "333"}, "Large 1600": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_86e1ba50ac_h.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/h/", "height": "1600", "width": "1067"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/s/", "height": "240", "width": "160"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/n/", "height": "320", "width": "213"}, "Large 2048": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_737404f49f_k.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/k/", "height": "2048", "width": "1365"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/l/", "height": "1024", "width": "683"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/z/", "height": "640", "width": "427"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/t/", "height": "100", "width": "67"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Medium 800": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15353729037_93bcacda7d_c.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353729037/sizes/c/", "height": "800", "width": "534"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dba\u0dcf - Lion", "id": "15353729037"}

If you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it.\n -- W. Somerset Maugham\n\n\nRed Fox, Vulpes vulpes. Loveland, Colorado.  Foxes are amazingly adaptable to living near humans.  I found this yearling pup just utside my hotel in the city after a day of\nhiking in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Lots of great scenery, but little in the way of elusive animals.  He was a very pleasant surprise, letting me get really close.  Maybe \nit was a case of misery loving company, as it was another weekend away from home for me.

This female cat was cute   as a kitten too. When she was young and curious,  she ran after attractive butterflies and was always looking gorgeous. Her eyes were blue at birth and turned more green later in life. The yellow fur is typical for Singaporean cats. \n\nThe red nose is the best sign that this free living cat is healthy. The creative portrait of this animal is my favourite digital pet for the computer wallpaper of this good picture with green eyes.\n\nThe cat or domestic cat is a small carnivorous mammal of the family Felidae. The cat is in coexistence near to the human being for approximately 9500 years, 1 period superior to the dear previously, who was ranging between 3500 and 8000 years.\n\nHouse cats are about fifty centimetres long on average and four kilogrammes with a big variation width of approx. 2.5 kg to approx. 8 kg. \n\nThe house cat in the wild type owns a m-shaped drawing on the forehead, dominant a dark dark stripe on the animal's back and dark bars on the body sides. Legs and tail are also dark geb\u00e4ndert. Your colour varies from grey-black up to warm brown tones.\n\nIn the house living cats reach with care by the person as a rule an age from 12 to 15 years. It are booked now and then age of 20 up to 25 years. Cats live very long if they eat more fish.\n\nThe big eyes are aimed head-on by which spatial sight and exact estimating of distances are possible.

Except for the Cape Barren goose, which has adapted to be more of a landlubber, most geese have webbed feet, a streamlined body and thick plumage, which makes them extremely buoyant.\n\n<b>Goose Lifestyle:</b> Geese are medium to large birds and migrate long distances from overwintering sites to breeding grounds. All geese eat a vegetarian diet, feeding on grasses, seeds and grains.\n\n<b>Mates for Life:</b> Geese usually mate for life, though a small number will separate and find another mate.

Thank you!\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe story behind this shot:\n\nThis was a very rewarding shot. I had seen a fox early in the morning that day, but didn't have my camera with me. It kinda sucked... But then at around 5:00 PM my friend calls me that there's a fox sleeping in my uncle's backyard. So I pick up my camera and head there. There it was sleeping quietly and I took a few shots. Walked a little closer and it raised its head to see what was going on. Again, took a few shots and walked closer. Then it stood up and started staring at me. Took a few shots and tried to sneak in closer for some closeups. It started walking towards the woods but stopped to stretch after a few steps. When it was done, it turned back to stare at me. That's when I took this shot. Still tried to get a little closer (I was about 7 meters/23 ft away) but then it took off towards the nearby woods. Followed it for long, but couldn't get shots from close range.\nDidn't mind about missing the fox that morning, when I saw the outcome of this shot. :)\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis shot just became my first to be published on a newspaper/magazine. :)", "owner": {"username": "jeppe2", "id": "8358093@N08", "realname": "Joni-Pekka Luomala"}, "title": "\"Who you lookin at?\" (Explored)"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_300f35f161_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/o/", "height": "800", "width": "1059"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/m/", "height": "378", "width": "500"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/s/", "height": "181", "width": "240"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90_z.jpg?zz=1", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/z/", "height": "483", "width": "640"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3592/3513204333_823b954b90_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeppe2/3513204333/sizes/t/", "height": "76", "width": "100"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "\"Who you lookin at?\" (Explored)", "id": "3513204333"}

They are reactions to some allergy of unknown source. I took him to the vet last week to have the doctor look at his current batch and possibly give him a steroid injection. While looking him over, she found a mass at the very back of his tongue - it was unlike anything she'd ever seen. She put him on both steroids and antibiotics simultaneously which isn't done very often. We hope it responds to one or the other because it's in an inoperable spot. He loves eating his dry food which makes me think the mass doesn't hurt or interfere with his eating and he is the world's easiest cat to pill.

Tuvo lugar el 16 de enero de 1809 entre 14.000 soldados brit\u00e1nicos bajo el mando de Sir John Moore, y 16.000 soldados franceses bajo el mando de Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult.\n\n las condiciones invernales que costaron la vida de 6.000 soldados brit\u00e1nicos. La retirada posterior, realizada durante un severo invierno, fue un completo desastre. Las marchas agotadoras, el tiempo g\u00e9lido y las frecuentes escaramuzas con la vanguardia de las tropas francesas provocaron una ca\u00edda en el alcoholismo de numerosas tropas, y su consiguiente abandono ante el avance franc\u00e9s.\n\nEstas condiciones, unidas a la sorpresiva llegada del propio Napole\u00f3n con un ej\u00e9rcito a Espa\u00f1a, forzaron a Moore a iniciar la retirada completa hacia el puerto de La Coru\u00f1a, en la esquina noroccidental de Espa\u00f1a. Razones pol\u00edticas y una serie de acciones brit\u00e1nicas tenaces y sorpresivas en la propia retaguardia francesa hicieron que Napole\u00f3n decidiera dejar la persecuci\u00f3n en manos del mariscal Soult\n\nEl encuentro entre los dos ej\u00e9rcitos se produjo en el llano de Elvi\u00f1a, en las inmediaciones de la ciudad de La Coru\u00f1a, en la que se hallaban fondeados los barcos de la Royal Navy dispuestos para la evacuaci\u00f3n. Lejos de actuar como un ej\u00e9rcito derrotado y diezmado, las tropas brit\u00e1nicas se propusieron proteger la evacuaci\u00f3n rechazando los ataques franceses, normalmente mediante la propia infanter\u00eda ligera creada por Moore.\n\nCogiendo lo mejor que quedaba de sus tropas (entre ellos los regimientos 51st Highlanders y 95th Rifles), Moore se enfrent\u00f3 a los franceses y consigui\u00f3 evitar la destrucci\u00f3n total, dando a sus exhaustas tropas el tiempo necesario para embarcar en los transportes anclados en el puerto. El propio Moore fue herido en el pecho por un proyectil de ca\u00f1\u00f3n durante la batalla, falleciendo poco despu\u00e9s en la ciudad de La Coru\u00f1a, pero con la satisfacci\u00f3n de ver c\u00f3mo su ej\u00e9rcito se salvaba de la destrucci\u00f3n.\n\nEl fuego de cobertura de los barcos de guerra mantuvo a Soult a distancia permitiendo a los brit\u00e1nicos embarcar sin problemas y retornar sanos y salvos a Gran Breta\u00f1a. Los sucesivos ataques franceses fueron rechazados y el ej\u00e9rcito brit\u00e1nico se retir\u00f3 con aproximadamente 900 bajas (entre muertos y heridos) incluyendo al propio Sir John Moore.

The single member of the genus Clytoceyx is commonly referred to as the shovel-billed kookaburra.\n\nThe kookaburra's loud call sounds like echoing human laughter. Kookaburras are not closely associated with water. They are found in habitats ranging from humid forest to arid savanna, as well as in suburban areas with tall trees or near running water.\n\nRead more :\n<a href=\"http://goo.gl/awnSK2\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/awnSK2</a>\n<a href=\"http://goo.gl/3J6P5p\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/3J6P5p</a>\n\nDD.CAP.2014.10.06.000068\n\u00a9 Dilan Damith Prasanga | 2014\nUpload time 2014.10.15 - 9.45AM", "owner": {"username": "Dilan Damith Prasanga's", "id": "28326885@N03", "realname": ""}, "title": "Kookaburra - \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0db9\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dcf"}, "sizes": {"Original": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_a7bcf77857_o.gif", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/o/", "height": "1800", "width": "1200"}, "Medium": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/m/", "height": "500", "width": "333"}, "Large 1600": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_4e729fe3c9_h.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/h/", "height": "1600", "width": "1067"}, "Large": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_b.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/l/", "height": "1024", "width": "683"}, "Medium 640": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_z.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/z/", "height": "640", "width": "427"}, "Small": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_m.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/s/", "height": "240", "width": "160"}, "Large Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_q.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/q/", "height": "150", "width": "150"}, "Medium 800": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_c.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/c/", "height": "800", "width": "534"}, "Small 320": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_n.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/n/", "height": "320", "width": "213"}, "Square": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_s.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/sq/", "height": "75", "width": "75"}, "Thumbnail": {"source": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15353847917_b7f0e41608_t.jpg", "url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/dilandamith/15353847917/sizes/t/", "height": "100", "width": "67"}}, "favs": 50, "title": "Kookaburra - \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0db9\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dcf", "id": "15353847917"}

They live in lowland and submontane tropical moist forest, swamp forest, semi-deciduous forest and Acacia forest.\n    Humans, other primates, African eagles and leopards are predators.

Because I now let the cats in and out when I'm home, I didn't figure out until last night that he had hidden under a bed and didn't eat, drink or use the litter box for about 24 hours.  I decided to see if he felt better by this morning and if not, take him to the vet first thing.  Well, absolutely no improvement so after a nearly sleepless night, I took him in.  Liver enzymes suggest he ingested some sort of mild toxin.  After lots of tests and treatments Mack is home and is feeling better - even eating and socializing.  He's going to be fine but this whole episode reminded me again of why I like working at an animal hospital.
